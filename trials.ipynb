Over the years labour laws have undergone a change with regard to the object and scope. \\nEarly labour legislation was enacted to safeguard the interest of employers. It was governed \\nby the doctrine of laissez faire. Modern labour legislation on the other hand aims at protecting \\nworkers against exploitation by employers. The advent of doctrine of welfare state is based on \\nthe notion of progressive social philosophy which has rendered the old doctrine of laissez faire \\nobsolete. The theory of “hire and fire” as well as the theory of “supply and demand” which found \\nfree scope under the old doctrine of laissez faire no longer holds good. The purpose of this Unit \\nis to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you should be \\nable to understand various concepts regarding the philosophy of labour laws.'),\n",

The access of this law is the widest, in that it touches the lives of far more people, \\nindeed millions of men & women as compared to any other branch of law and this is the aspect \\nwhich makes it the most fascinating of all branches of law and the study of this subject is of \\nenormous dimension and of ever changing facets.\\nThere has been a remarkable change in the approach to Labour law and industrial relations \\nsince the World War II Philadelphia Charter adopted in 1944 provided that “Labour is not a \\ncommodity” and that “poverty anywhere is a danger to prosperity everywhere”. W. Friedmann \\nand others who have tried to analyse the essential characteristics of the legal development in this \\nbranch of law consider ‘social-duty’ on the part of employer as the main bed rock on which this \\nlaw is built. This is exemplified by the very approach of law makers to the construction of a wage \\npacket of the working man in the post-second World War period, wage fixation and legislation \\nrelating to condition of work. The Indian Constitution lays down broad guidelines to be followed \\nby State.\\nDid u know?  The Supreme Court in D.N. Banerji v. P.R. Mukherjee, AIR 1953 SC 58 stated \\nthat the law as developed after the second World War, particularly in a welfare State has \\nreversed the theories of Sir Henry Maine and now society progresses form contract to \\nstatus and the post war world has seen considerable legislation laying down conditions of \\nservice and also ensuring by laws payment of minimum wages.\\n1.1.1 Basis of Labour Relations Law\\nOtto Kahn-Freund in his book on Labour and the Law makes the following points:\\n(i) The system of collective bargaining rests on a balance of the collective forces of \\nmanagement and organised labour. The contribution which the courts have made to \\nthe orderly development of collective labour relations has been infinitesimal. Collective \\nbargaining is a process by which the terms of employment and conditions of service are \\ndetermined by agreement between management and the union. In effect, “It is a business \\ndeal (which) determines the price of labour services and terms and conditions of labour’s \\nemployment.” \\n(ii) The Law governing labour relation is one of the central branches of the law on which the \\nvery large majority of people earn their living. Nonetheless, law is a secondary force in \\nhuman relations and especially in labour relations.\\n(iii) Law is a technique for the regulation of social power. This is true of labour law as it is of \\nother aspects of any legal system. Labour Law also seeks to lay down minimum standard of \\nemployment. It lays down norms by which basic conditions of labour are fulfilled such as \\nmaximum working hours, minimum safety conditions, minimum provisions for holidays \\nand leave protection for women and children from arduous labour, prohibition of children \\nbelow certain age from employment and provision for minimum standards of separation \\nbenefits and certain provision for old age.\\n1.1.2 Purpose of Labour Legislation\\nLabour legislation that is adapted to the economic and social challenges of the modern world of \\nwork fulfils three crucial roles:\\n(i) It establishes a legal system that facilitates productive individual and collective employment \\nrelationships, and therefore a productive economy;'),\n",

The most \\nefficient way of ensuring that these conditions and needs are taken fully into account is if those \\nconcerned are closely involved in the formulation of the legislation through processes of social \\ndialogue. The involvement of stakeholders in this way is of great importance in developing a \\nbroad basis of support for labour legislation and in facilitating its application within and beyond \\nthe formal structured sectors of the economy.\\n\\uf026\\nCaselet  Airport Authority of India\\nT\\nhe writ petition was filed by the Airport Authority of India, challenging the impugned \\norder passed by the authority under Rule 25 (2)(v)(a) & (b) of Contract Labour \\n(R&A) Central Rules dated 27.04.2001, whereby it was held that the members of \\nthe second respondent in the category of Safaiwala/cleaner/sweeper under the contractor \\nengaged by the petitioner are performing not the same, but similar work as performed by \\nthe corresponding category of directly employed workers of the petitioner. The provision \\ncontained under Rule 25(2)(v)(a) of the Contract Labour Act, 1971, makes it very clear \\nthat in a case where the contract workman performs the same or similar kind of work \\nas the workmen directly employed by the Principal employer, then the benefits to such \\na contract workman shall be the same, as applicable to the workmen directly employed \\nby the principal employer. Therefore the said rule mandates that the benefits shall be \\nequal both to a workmen engaged by a contractor as well as the workmen engaged by the \\nprincipal employer. The Court held that no distinction can be made against Contract labour. \\nContract labour is entitled to the same wages, holidays, hours of work and conditions of \\nservice as are applicable to workmen directly employed by the principal employer under \\nthe appropriate industrial and labour laws. If there is any dispute with regard to the type \\nof work, the dispute has to be decided by the Chief Labour Commissioner. Thus the Court \\nheld that the order impugned is perfectly in order and no interference needs to be called \\nfor and accordingly dismissed the writ petition. \\nSource: http://www.chadha-co.com/pdfs/C&Co-Labour-Law-Update-April-May-2012.pdf\\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n1.

The Preamble has been amplified and elaborated in Part IV of the Constitution, which \\ndeals with the Directive Principle of State Policy. The State has been directed to promote the \\nwelfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as may, a social order in which \\njustice, social economic and political, shall inform all institutions of the national life. Further, the \\nState has been directed to strive to secure, inter alia, \\n(i) an adequate means of livelihood, \\n(ii) the proper distribution of ownership and control of the, material resources of the community \\nso that it may best subserve the common need, \\n(iii) the prevention of the concentration of wealth and means of production,\\n(iv) equal pay for equal work to men and women, \\n(v) the health and strength of workers, \\n(vi) right to work,\\n(vii) right to education and to public assistance in cases of undeserved want, just and humane \\nconditions of work and for maternity relief, \\n(viii) living wage and decent standard of life to labourers \\n(ix) higher level nutrition and standard of living and improved public health. \\nThe Directive Principles spell out the socio-economic objectives of the national policy to be realised \\nby labour; legislation as well as by other legislations. These are directives to the legislature, \\nexecutive and the judiciary, which are committed to make, interpret and enforce law.\\n1.2.2 Constitutional Limitations on Labour Laws\\nAlthough labour policy seeks to create high minimum standards of employment, the choice \\nof the legislature in seeking to achieve the objective are not unqualified. Minimum standard \\nlegislation is subject to various limitations. To begin with, in order to guarantee the fundamental \\nrights, the Indian Constitution imposes certain limitations on the legislations on the legislature \\nand the executive. To the extent it is inconsistent with or derogatory to a fundamental right, the \\nlegislation is void. Fundamental rights are enforceable by the courts under Articles 32 and 226. \\nThe fundamental rights are enumerated in Part-III of the Constitution. The whole object of Part-\\nIII is to provide protection for the freedom and rights mentioned therein against arbitrary action'),\n",

Of particular relevance is Article 14, which provides that “the State shall not deny \\nto any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of \\nIndia”. In addition to this, Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public \\nemployment. Further, Article 19 guarantees “the right to freedom of speech and expression, to \\nassemble peaceably and without arms, to form associations or unions, to practice any profession, \\nand to cant’ on any occupation, trade or business.” These constitutional guarantees are of great \\npractical significance in the area of labour law, including minimum standard legislation. Equal; \\nprotection constitutes a limitation on the legislative power to select or decide which business or \\nindustry must achieve minimum standards. The right to carry on trade profession or business \\nlimits the burden which the legislation may place on business in the interest of workers. The \\nfreedom of speech, assembly, association and unionisation protect workers in their efforts to \\nachieve their objectives through self in organising, picketing or striking. \\nArticle 21 provides protection of life and personal liberty. It provides that no person shall be \\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Article \\n23 prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour. It says (i) Traffic in human beings and \\nbeggar and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this \\nprovision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. Life, in Article 21, has been \\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court as including livelihood and the Court has held in several cases \\nthat any employment below minimum wage levels is impermissible as it accounts to slavery \\nas understood in Article 23. Holding a person in bondage is a Constitutional crime. Article 24 \\nplaces a ban on employment below the age of 14 in any factory or mine or engaged in any other \\nhazardous employment.\\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n4.

Article 19 provides protection of life and personal liberty.\\n1.3 Social Justice and Labour Laws\\nIn the realm of labour laws there has been in reality continuous legislative activity by the \\nSupreme Court ever since the Constitution was promulgated. The Supreme Court has performed \\na pioneering role in evolving first principles of industrial law which are so sound that they are \\nlargely still followed today despite the dynamic nature of industrial law. \\nThe fundamental principle which was laid down by the Supreme Court in this respect was \\nthe principle of social Justice. In fact, other principles of labour law only flow from this basic \\nprinciple, and hence we may consider it at some length. Social Justice connotes the balance of \\nadjustments of the various interests concerned in the social and economic structure of society. It \\naims at promoting harmony in Industrial relations upon an ethical and economic basis, and its \\nultimate objective of peace in Industry. Thus, social justice is an objective of peace in industry. \\nThus, social justice is an application in the field of labour laws of the basic principle of sociological \\njurisprudence of harmonising conflicting interests. Social Justice recognised that workers are in a \\nweak bargaining position vis-a-vis the employer, and it seeks to remedy this situation. \\nDid u know?  In J.K. Cotton Spinning &Weaving Mills v.

The concept of social justice is not narrow or one-sided or \\npedantic. Its sweep is comprehensive. It is founded on the basic ideal of socio-economic \\nequality and its aim is to assist the removal of socio-economic disparities. Nevertheless \\nin dealing with industrial matters it does not adopt a doctrinaire approach and refuses to \\nyield blindly to abstract notions, but adopts a realistic and pragmatic approach. It therefore \\nendeavours to resolve the competing claims of employees by finding a solution which is \\njust and fair to both parties with the object of establishing harmony between labour and \\ncapital, and good relationship. The ultimate object of industrial adjudication is to help the \\ngrowth and progress of the national economy, and it is with that ultimate object in view \\nthat industrial disputes are settled by industrial adjudication.”\\nSocial justice is not based on contract. In fact it is an abridgement of the freedom of contract. The \\ndays of hire and fire are gone and the Industrial Court has power to intervene if it is demonstrated \\nthat the contract of employment needs to be revised in the interests of social Justice. In fact the \\nIndustrial Courts enjoy immense wide powers which no civil court possesses, namely, to create \\nnew contracts, modify existing contracts and confer new rights and privileges.\\nHowever the principle of social justice does not permit the Industrial Courts to act as despots \\nand do anything they please. The Industrial Court must follow Industrial law and decide the \\ndispute on settled principles. The Supreme Court has struck a note of caution that the need of \\nthe hour is more production; consequently the Tribunal should not be unduly generous in the \\nmatter of granting leave. Similarly, an Industrial Court cannot grant housing accommodation to \\nthe workers for this would impose too heavy a burden on the employer. \\nDid u know?  In Patna Electric Supply v. Workers Union, AIR 1959 SC 1036 the Supreme \\nCourt observed: \\n“Social Security for the weaker sections is of utmost importance. But then we cannot forget \\nthe limitations under which we are living. While we should not forget our social goals, our \\npurpose may be defeated if we do not approach our problems in a pragmatic way. “\\nThus, social justice requires the Industrial Courts to strike a balance between the conflicting \\nclaims of employer and worker. While the employer has a fundamental right to run his business, \\nhis right has to be adjusted with the employees’ right to social justice. The former pertains to the \\nrealm of fundamental rights in our Constitution, the latter to the realm of the Directive Principles. \\nThe Ultimate aim is to have peace in industry so that production may increase and the national \\neconomy may grow. \\nSelf Assessment\\nFill in the blanks:\\n7.

Union of India, popularly known as \\nthe Transfer of Judges case AIR 1982 SC 149 formulated the principle of public interest \\nlitigation in the following words:\\n“Where a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class \\nof persons by reason of violation of any constitutional or legal right or any burden is \\nimposed in contravention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority \\nof law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such \\nperson or determinate class of persons is by reason of poverty, helplessness or disability or \\neconomically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the Court for relief, any member \\nof the public can maintain an application for an appropriate direction or writ or order.”\\nIn People’s Union for Democratic Rights v Union of India (1982) 2 L.L.J 454 popularly known as \\nAsiad case the Court found the view, which held that public interest litigation unnecessarily clog \\nthe dockets of the Court and add to the already staggering arrears of cases pending for years and \\nshould be discouraged, to be totally perverse, smacking of an elitist and status quo approach. \\nOn the contrary, the Court found that the doors of the courts were open for vindicating the right \\nof the wealthy and the affluent and held that those who have decried public interest litigation \\ndid not seem to realise that courts were not meant only for the rich and the well-to-do, for the \\nlandlord and the gentry, for the business magnate and the industrial tycoon, but they existed also \\nfor the poor and the downtrodden. The Court accordingly treated the letter written to a judge to \\nbe a writ petition. \\nPIL represents the first attempt by a developing common law country to break away from legal \\nimperialism perpetuated for centuries. It contests the assumption that the most western the law, \\nthe better it must work for economic and social development such law produced in developing \\nstates, including India, was the development of under develop men. The shift from legal \\ncentralism to legal pluralism was prompted by the disillusionment with formal legal system. \\nIn India, however instead of seeking to evolve justice- dispensing mechanism ousted the formal \\nlegal system itself through PIL. The change as we have seen, are both substantial and structural. \\nIt has radically altered the traditional judicial role so as to enable the court to bring justice within \\nthe reach of the common man. Further, it is humbly submitted that PIL is still is in experimental \\nstage. Many deficiencies in handling the kind of litigation are likely to come on the front. But these \\ndeficiencies can be removed by innovating better techniques. In essence, the PIL develops a new \\njurisprudence of the accountability of the state for constitutional and legal violations adversely \\naffecting the interests of the weaker elements in the community. We may end with the hope once \\nexpressed by Justice Krishna Iyer, “The judicial activism gets its highest bonus when its orders \\nwipe some tears from some eyes”.\\n!\\nCaution  Public Interest Litigation is not defined in any statute or in any act. It has been \\ninterpreted by judges to consider the intent of public at large. Although, the main and \\nonly focus of such litigation is only “Public Interest” there are various areas where a Public \\nInterest Litigation can be filed.'),\n",

So also when the provisions allege non-observance of the \\nprovisions of the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 it is in effect and substance a complaint of breach \\nof the principle of equality before the law enshrined in Art 14. Then there is the complaint of non-\\nobservance of the provision of the Contract Labour (Regulations &Abolition) Act 1970 and the \\nInter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 \\nand this is also in our opinion a complaint relating to violation of Art.21.”\\nFurther it was added: \\n“Now the rights and benefit on the workmen employed by a contractor under the provisions of \\nthe Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 and the Inter-State Migrant Workmen \\n(Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 are clearly intended to ensure \\nbasic human dignity to the workmen and if the workmen are deprived of any of these rights \\nand benefits to which they are entitled under the provisions of these two pieces of social \\nwelfare legislation, that would clearly be a violation of Article 21 by the Union of India, the \\nDelhi Administration and the Delhi Development Authority which, as principal employers, are \\nmade staturily responsible for securing such rights and benefits to the workmen.

The tribunal is not bound by the rigid rules of law. \\nThe process it employs is rather an extended form of the process of collective bargaining and is \\nmore akin to administrative than to judicial function. Adjudication is a procedure for resolving \\ndisputes without resorting to lengthy and expensive court procedure.\\nDisciplining a workman is one of the key methods of curtailing disputes amongst them and \\nachieving maximum productivity.\\n Example: Accordingly, the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) in Hombe Gowda Educational \\nTrust v. State of Karnataka, stated that giving managers the power to punish a workman according \\nto law, even if the punishment may result in some hardship is important. But, one needs to bear \\nin mind that conducting disciplinary proceedings against a workman is most controversial and \\noften lead to long drawn-out cases. Hence, the management of any industrial establishment must \\ncautiously approach such proceedings and strictly follow the procedure laid down by judicial \\nprecedents. The present bulletin focuses on the requirements of holding a domestic enquiry with \\nrespect to indiscipline on part of a workman, the procedure to be followed thereunder and the \\nimpact of section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (“the Act”) on domestic enquiries. \\n1.5.1 The Adjudication Process\\nFollowing are the processes of Adjudication:\\nCommencement\\nThe adjudication process begins when the party referring the dispute to adjudication gives \\nwritten notice of its intention to do so. The Scheme for Construction Contracts provides that this \\nNotice of Adjudication should briefly set out the following:\\nzl a description of the nature of the dispute and the parties involved;\\nzl details of where and when the dispute arose;\\nzl the nature of the remedy being sought;\\nzl names and addresses of the parties to the contract, including addresses where documents \\nmay be served.\\nThe Notice of Adjudication is the first formal step in the adjudication procedure. Save for the \\nminimum information set out above, there is no particular requirement as to the form of the \\ndocument.\\nAppointment of the Adjudicator\\nFollowing service of the Notice of Adjudication, the next step is to appoint an adjudicator. The \\nappointment of an adjudicator must be secured within seven days from service of the Notice of \\nAdjudication. The parties can agree on an individual to act as the adjudicator or, if agreement \\ncannot be reached, the party who referred the dispute to adjudication may make an application \\nto an Adjudicator Nominating Body (ANB). This is usually done by completing a form and \\npaying the required fee. On receipt of a request to nominate an adjudicator, the ANB should \\ncommunicate their selection to the party who referred the dispute to adjudication within five \\ndays of the request. In the event that an ANB fails to do this the whole process must begin \\nagain.'),\n",

It is important to ensure that the referring \\nparty is in a position to serve this notice - there have been instances where the ANB has appointed \\nan adjudicator 24 hours before the seven-day period expires, in which case the adjudicator will \\nneed the notice within a day. A copy should be sent to the other party at the same time.\\nTimetable involved\\nThe Construction Act sets out a tight timetable of within 28 days of service of the referral notice \\nfor submission of a response and for the adjudicator’s ultimate decision. However this may be \\nextended with the consent of the adjudicator. The rationale behind the process was to obtain \\nquick and cost effective results which are of a binding nature unless reviewed by litigation or \\narbitration. This relies on timescales being tight.\\nResponding party’s response\\nThis is essentially the other party’s defence, and is required to be served within seven days of the \\nReferral Notice. Requests for this to be extended to 14 days are usually agreed. The HGCRA does \\nnot demand a response or further submissions - the need for one is a matter for the adjudicator.\\nThe decision\\nThe adjudicator is required to reach his decision within 28 days of service of the referral notice. \\nThis period can be extended by a further 14 days if the party who referred the dispute in the first \\nplace agrees, or can be further extended if both parties agree.\\nThe decision is final and binding, providing it is not challenged by subsequent arbitration or \\nlitigation. The parties are obliged to comply with the decision of the adjudicator, even if they \\nintend to pursue court or arbitration proceedings. In the majority of adjudicators’ decisions the \\nparties accept the decision, however if they choose to pursue subsequent proceedings the dispute \\nwill be heard afresh - not as an ‘appeal’ of the adjudicator’s findings. A party cannot adjudicate \\nthe same issue in further adjudication proceedings.\\nCosts\\nThe Construction Act makes no mention of how costs should be dealt with. However changes to \\nthe Act which come into force on 1 October 2011 provide that any contractual provision which \\nattempts to allocate the costs of adjudication between the parties will be invalid unless it is made \\nafter the adjudicator is appointed. This applies to agreements both as to the allocation of the \\nadjudicator’s fees and expenses and agreements as to who is to bear the parties’ own costs. This \\nprovision seeks to prevent parties agreeing contractual terms which place all the costs risk on \\none party.\\nAdjudicator’s fees and expenses\\nThe parties will be jointly and severally liable to pay the adjudicator a reasonable amount in \\nrespect of fees for work reasonably undertaken and expenses reasonably incurred by him. This \\nmeans that both parties can be pursued for these fees, or that either party may be pursued for the \\nwhole amount. The adjudicator may decide himself what sum is reasonable but, if there is any \\ndispute, an application can be made to the court for determination. This provision applies only'),\n",

After \\nrecovering from the strike Maruti had a perceptible change in culture. A VRS scheme \\nintroduced soon afterwards increased the sense of insecurity amongst employees, but it \\nwas all for a good cause.\\nDuring the 1980s and early 90s the level of employee satisfaction at Maruti was comparatively \\nhigher than most manufacturing companies in the country as they received significantly \\nhigher salaries as compared to employees of other companies. Generally the Wage rates \\nand earnings of workers at Maruti were result of a series of revisions based on bilateral \\nnegotiations. The pre-revised (before 2001 strike) labour cost per vehicle in Maruti at  \\n` 2,696 compared unfavorably with  ` 1,617 of its closest rival Hyundai. Worker’s incentive \\nearning had been equal to almost their entire basic and dearness. In 2000, the average basic \\nand dearness allowance was  ` 7,000 and the incentive earnings were around  `  6,500. With \\nincentives accounting for a more than as usual and sizable proportion of the pay packet, \\nworkers badly needed the incentive scheme. Maruti’s worked formed part of middle class, \\nnot working class. Over two-thirds apparently owned flats/houses and cars.\\nIn MUL the control and power is mostly in the hands of management. During the workers \\nstrike in 2000 the management refused to agree to the workers demands. The officers ran \\nthe plant by supervising the operations of the plant and hiring contractual labour. This \\nmade it difficult for workers to sustain the strike. They had to call off the strike and were \\nin fact forced them to agree to some changes laid down by the management. The power of \\nJapanese has always been there in an implicit manner. The Japanese have acted as conflict \\nresolvers whenever there have been any conflicts within or between departments. Many \\ntimes the departments play politics with other departments by trying to use the referent \\npower available due to closeness with Japanese management. With the increase in stake \\nof Suzuki Motor Corp. the legitimate power of the Japanese management has further \\nincreased.\\nThe car market in India become highly competitive in late 1990s with almost all major \\nplayers entering the Indian market with manufacturing of various models. So company \\nsuffered a decline of market share. As Maruti’s salary structure comparatively higher than \\nmost manufacturing companies, due to this competition and decline in profit, the company \\ncould not live up to the expectations of the employees. As a result worker unrest started to \\ngrow in the company.\\nIn September 2000 the Maruti Udyog Employees Union went on an indefinite strike if \\ntheir demands were not met. The employees were demanding a new incentive scheme, \\nimproved pension scheme, better work environment and filling up of supervisory \\nvacancies. However the management refused to accede to these demands.\\nProduction fell by around 40 % for a period of 3 months. During this period the engineers \\nat the managerial positions manned the assembly lines to ensure that production does not \\nstop completely. The top management of Maruti were under some pressure to negotiate \\nwith the workers. However, the government decided not to interfere directly and the \\nmanagement insisted that the workers stop the agitation and agree to adhere to the code of \\nconduct specified by them.\\nThe strike ended in January 2001 with the union members agreeing to by the code of \\nconduct. About half of the employees (40) suspended/terminated during the course of the \\nagitation were not taken back on duty. Thus the management retained the upper hand after \\nthe strike ended and the work culture at Maruti changed significantly after this. Some of \\nthe changes which took place were as follows:\\n1.

For instance, the static dimension of any given \\nsociety would be the definition of that society at a particular moment of history. The dynamic \\ndimension would be the stages of the evolution of that society upto the moment of the present \\nanalysis. The totality of the static dimension of society would include the techno-economic, \\npolitico-legal, socio-cultural structures and processes. The dynamic aspect of any society would \\nfocus on the mode of production, relations of production and relations in production. Hence, an \\nanalysis of any aspect of society should be sensitive not only to its present mode but should also \\nbe sensitive to how the present mode has evolved. Any discussion of strategic industrial relations \\nmanagement should take into account the mode of production and the relations of production as \\nwell as the techno-economic, politico-legal and socio-cultural structures and processes given the \\ndominant mode of production. \\nThe “totality” referred to above is not by any means a harmonious configuration of parts. There \\nare inherent contradictions in the totality given the relations of production of a given mode of \\nproduction. Sensitivity to the structural contradictions of the totality is essential to any analysis \\nof human resources management. The structural contradictions flow from the struggle between \\nthose who own and/or control production and those who sell their labour for wages. The \\nforms of these struggles will vary depending on the mode of production and the relations of \\nproduction; labour management relations and human resources development are conceptualised \\nand operationalised within the framework of a contradiction-ridden totality both at the societal \\nlevel as well as at the organisational level. \\nThe worker experiences the work organisation as alienating. The politico-economic structure of \\nthe work organisation, the drive towards profit generation, the hierarchy of control, division of \\nlabour, the dehumanising structure of work processes, exploitative management practices and \\nprocedures, the manipulation of worker behaviour in organisations and other factors combine to \\nform the basis of the worker experience of alienation. \\nThe alienation of the worker consists in a complex of factors: \\n1. That work is external to the worker. It does not flow from his own creativity, from his \\nown volition, from his own aspirations. The politico-economic structure of the work \\nenvironment divests the worker of his power to control the modalities of his working life. \\n2. Working is forced on the worker because of the urgent need for satisfying his various \\nsurvival needs. Work itself is not the satisfaction of a need but merely a means. \\n3. As a worker, he surrenders his freedom to the organisation and to impersonal market \\nforces in return for wages. His condition amounts to wage slavery. \\n4. The alienated worker, therefore, has no control over what work he has to do, what his work \\nis going to produce and also over the structure and process enveloping his working life. \\nHe, on the contrary, through his work, creates power structures and processes which in \\nturn contribute relentlessly to his own oppression and exploitation. \\n\\uf026\\nCaselet  Anant Spinning Mills\\nT\\nhe Union of the workers gave a demand notice under section 2K of ID Act 1947 \\nto the management of Anant Spinning Mills, Mandideep.

HRM is a complex blend of science and art, creativity \\nand common sense. At one level, HR practice draws on economics, psychology, sociology, \\nanthropology, political studies, and strategic and systems thinking. At an operational level, \\nsuccess depends on interpersonal relationships. HR professionals are often the “go to” people \\nin an organisation for advice and information. When things go wrong employees rely on the \\nintegrity and ability of HRM staff to manage and advice on issues without taking sides. They \\nmay also train and develop staff to ensure the business performs well, that it meets its goals and \\ncontinually improves within legislative frameworks. HRM practitioners also keep up-to-date \\nwith legislation and analyse contemporary employment issues.\\nIndustrial relations are also a multidisciplinary field that studies the collective aspects of the \\nemployment relationship. It is increasingly being called employment relations (ER) because of the \\nimportance of non-industrial employment relationships. IR has a core concern with social justice \\nthrough fair employment practices and decent work. People often think industrial relations is \\nabout labour relations and unionised employment situations, but it is more than that. Industrial \\nrelations covers issues of concern to managers and employees at the workplace, including \\nworkplace bargaining, management strategy, employee representation and participation, union-\\nmanagement co-operation, workplace reform, job design, new technology and skill development. \\nAn IR expert will more usually work for a trade union in order to represent employees’ interests. \\nHowever, they may work for an employer in an HRM department, or for an employers’ \\nassociation or consultancy, serving the employers’ interests. Major tasks of HRM and IR are: \\nhiring staff, negotiation of employment contracts and conditions, performance management and \\nreward systems, dispute resolution, disciplinary processes, ensuring health and safety of staff, \\nemployee motivation, design of work, team and organisation restructuring, and training and \\ndevelopment. \\nHRM practitioners are responsible not only for the smooth running of processes but also at a \\nsenior level for the bigger picture planning, strategising and policy-making as they affect staff \\nand employment relationships. Senior HRM practitioners can take a lead in advising on the where \\nand the how of an organisation’s direction - on the staffing, skills and training requirements to get \\nthere and on the communication or influencing processes needed to pave the way. For example, \\nan organisation establishing online services will require a certain skill set to deliver this. The HR \\nfunction will assess current staff capability, their training needs, and the options if some staff \\nis unable to meet requirements. Managers in a company may also fulfill many HRM functions. \\nSmaller businesses may not employ HRM professionals. Instead they may use HRM consultants \\nas needed, or do it themselves with variable success. \\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n5.

This section concerns itself with the first of these two issues. \\nIn considering the issue, it is necessary to identify the broad goals of each discipline. The goals \\nof HRM have already been identified in the previous section. It remains to consider some of the \\nbasic objectives of IR, which could be said to include the following:\\n1. The efficient production of goods and services and, at the same time, determination of \\nadequate terms and conditions of employment, in the interests of the employer, employees \\nand society as a whole, through a consensus achieved through negotiation.\\n2. The establishment of mechanisms for communication, consultation and cooperation in \\norder to resolve workplace issues at enterprise and industry level, and to achieve through \\na tripartite process, consensus on labour policy at national level.\\n3. Avoidance and settlement of disputes and differences between employers, employees \\nand their representatives, where possible through negotiation and dispute settlement \\nmechanisms.\\n4. To provide social protection where needed e.g. in the areas of social security, safety and \\nhealth, child labour, etc.\\n5. Establishment of stable and harmonious relations between employers and employees and \\ntheir organizations, and between them and the State.\\nIR is essentially pluralistic in outlook, in that it covers not only the relations between employer \\nand employee (the individual relations) but also the relations between employers and unions and \\nbetween them and the State (collective relations). IR theory, practice and institutions traditionally \\nfocus more on the collective aspect of relations. This is evident from the central place occupied \\nby labour law, freedom of association, collective bargaining, the right to strike, employee \\ninvolvement practices which involve unions, trade unionism and so on. HRM deals with the \\nmanagement of human resources, rather than with the management of collective relations. \\nThere is of course a certain measure of overlap. Individual grievance handling falls within the \\nambit of both disciplines, but dispute settlement of collective issues more properly falls within \\nthe scope of IR. Policies and practices relating to recruitment, selection, appraisal, training \\nand motivation form a part of HRM. Team-building, communication and cooperation, though \\nprimarily HRM initiatives, have a collectivist aspect. Thus joint consultative mechanisms are as \\nmuch IR initiatives, which may (as in Japan) supplement collective bargaining. But IR has not, in \\nregard to team-building for instance, developed any techniques or theories about how to achieve \\nit; in fact, it is not a focus of attention because it implies a potential loyalty to the enterprise \\nthrough the team and is seen as conflicting with loyalty to the union. IR has a large component \\nof rules which govern the employment relationship. These rules may be prescribed by the State \\nthrough laws, by courts or tribunals, or through a bipartite process such as collective bargaining. \\nHRM differs in this respect from industrial relations in the sense that it does not deal with such \\nprocedures and rules, but with the best way to use the human resource through, for example, \\nproper selection and recruitment, induction, appraisal, training and development, motivation, \\nleadership and intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Thus “at its most basic HRM represents a set of \\nmanagerial initiatives.” Four processes central to a HRM system - selection, appraisal, rewards \\nand development - leave only limited room for IR as a central element in the human resource \\nsystem. “Based on theoretical work in the field of organizational behaviour it is proposed that \\nHRM comprises a set of policies designed to maximise organizational integration, employee \\ncommitment, flexibility and quality of work. Within this model, collective industrial relations \\nhave, at best, only a minor role.'),\n",

HRM increasingly places emphasis on monetary rewards \\nlinked to performance and skills through the development of performance and skills-based pay \\nsystems, some of which seek to individualise monetary rewards (e.g. individual bonuses, stock \\noptions, etc.).\\nHRM strategies to secure individual commitment through communication, consultation and \\nparticipatory schemes underline the individualisation thrust, or at least effect, of HRM strategies. \\nOn the other hand, it is also legitimate to argue that HRM does not focus exclusively on the \\nindividual and, as such, does not promote only individual employment relations.\\nNotes  The potential conflict between emphasizing the importance of the individual \\non the one hand, and the desirability of cooperative team work and employee commitment \\nto the organization, on the other, is glossed over through the general assumption of \\nunitarist values ..: HRM stresses the development of a strong corporate culture -not only \\ndoes it give direction to an organization, but it mediates the tension between individualism \\nand collectivism, as individuals socialised into a strong culture are subject to unobtrusive \\ncollective controls on attitudes and behaviour.\\nSome of the tensions between IR and HRM arise from the unitarist outlook of HRM (which sees a \\ncommonality of interests between managements and employees) and the pluralist outlook of IR \\n(which assumes the potential for conflict in the employment relationship flowing from different \\ninterests). “It is often said that HRM is the visual embodiment of the unitarist frame of reference \\nboth in the sense of the legitimation of managerial authority and in the imagery of the firm as \\na team with committed employees working with managers for the benefit of the firm.” How to \\nbalance these conflicting interests and to avoid or to minimize conflicts (e.g. through promotion \\nof negotiation systems such as collective bargaining, joint consultation, dispute settlement \\nmechanisms within the enterprise and at national level in the form of conciliation, arbitration \\nand labour courts) in order to achieve a harmonious IR system is one central task of IR. The \\nindividualization of HRM, reflected in its techniques which focus on direct employer-employee \\nlinks rather than with employee representatives, constitutes one important difference between \\nIR and HRM. \\nDid u know?  The empirical evidence also indicates that the driving force behind the \\nintroduction of HRM appears to have little to do with industrial relations; rather it is the \\npursuit of competitive advantage in the market place through provision of high-quality \\ngoods and services, through competitive pricing linked to high productivity and through \\nthe capacity swiftly to innovate and manage change in response to changes in the market \\nplace or to breakthroughs in research and development ... Its underlying values, reflected \\nin HRM policies and practices, would appear to be essentially unitarist and individualistic \\nin contrast to the more pluralist and collective values of traditional industrial relation.\\nTask  As a HR Manager, how will you eliminate the tensions between IR and HRM \\noccur from the unitarist viewpoint of HRM.'),\n",

Employers’ costs can increase due to workers organizing to win higher wages, or by \\nlaws imposing costly requirements, such as health and safety or equal opportunities conditions. \\nWorkers’ organizations, such as trade unions, can also transcend purely industrial disputes, and \\ngain political power - which some employers may oppose. The state of labour law at any one \\ntime is therefore both the product of, and a component of, struggles between different interests \\nin society. The purpose of this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. \\nAt the end of this unit you should be able to understand various concepts regarding the concept, \\norigin, objectives and classification of Labour Legislation.\\n3.1 The Concept of Labour Legislations\\nSociety evolves institutions to abhor vacuum created by changes. Industrial Revolution is an \\nepoch-making event, which completely changes the lifestyles of society from agricultural and \\npastoral to industrial and materialistic one. The industrial society brought about, in its wake, \\nexcessive exploitation of the working classes by the employer who took advantage of the individual \\ndispensability of the worker and wanted maximum profit on his investment. The golden rule of \\ncapitalism that “Risk and Right” go together provided them with prerogatives to “hire and fire”. \\nThe other legal concepts which were then available were those of Master and Servant and carrot \\nand stick etc. The principle of common law was in operation. The law of contract used to govern \\nthe relation between worker and the employer in which individual contact was struck, the terns \\nof contract were usually verbal and mostly used in cases of breaches, leading to prosecution \\nand imprisonment of workers. Labour and Migration Act was another legislation which gave \\nrise to the “Indentured labour system”. Anti-Combination legislations were in vague treating \\n‘combination’ of workers as act of criminal conspiracy. Longer hours of work, abysmally low \\nwages, no safety and welfare provisions, and no insurance - the exploitation at large. State was \\nadopting the policy of Laissez-faire (let not interfere) and employers abused workers, taking \\nadvantage of the situation. \\nEvery society on its onwards march revises, reviews, refurbishes and reinvents its legal concept \\nand civilised ways of living. The changes brought about by the industrial revolution created \\nsome gaps and it became the responsibility of the society to fill-up those gaps. Society went for \\ncertain social devices to take care of the gaps, which are known as labour legislation.\\nThe labour legislations are the products of Industrial Revolution and they have come into being \\nto take care of the aberrations created by it. They are different from common legislations, because \\nthey come to alleviate special disorders created by specific circumstances. Therefore, they are \\nspecific and not general in orientation, philosophy and concept.\\n3.1.1 The Main Ingredients of Labour Legislations\\nLabour legislation regards individuals as workers, whereas the general legislation regards him \\na citizen. The principles governing labour legislations are more influenced by the postulates of \\nsocial justice than general justice. Workers are the weaker class of industrial society and have \\nsuffered long at the hands of employers. Therefore, these sets of legislations go out of way in \\nprotecting workers and securing justice to them. The influences of ‘discriminative justice and \\ndistributive justice’ can be clearly seen over them. All the labour legislations are heavily skewed \\ntowards labour and they are specifically designed like that. \\nLabour legislation seeks to deal with problems arising out of occupational status of the \\nindividual. Consequently, such problems as hours of work, wages, working conditions, trade \\nunions, industrial disputes etc. come to be the main, subject matter of labour legislations. Thus, \\nthe behaviour of the individual or his groups is the function of labour legislation as of any other \\nlegislation. But under labour legislation, the individual is affected in the capacity of a worker \\nor an employer. Therefore, the persons who are neither the employers nor the workers are least \\naffected directly by labour legislation. To make the point clear, a few examples are necessary.'),\n",

On the contrary, a law regarding \\nownership of property or a law relating to the marriage or sales tax affects him as a citizen. \\nIndividuals have different roles to perform and different laws are designed for regulating the \\ndifferent roles. It is the role-relation that determines whether a particular legislation falls under \\nthe category of labour legislation, social legislation or general legislation. All these legislations \\ntry to meet the specific objectives of their respective target groups- that is:\\n(a) to provide subsistence,\\n(b) to aim at abundance,\\n(c) to encourage equality, and\\n(d) to maintain security.\\nAs labour legislations are to regulate the conditions of labour, in the industrial milieu, it \\nis required to be adjusted as per the changing requirements of industry. This has to be done \\nmore frequently than the general legislation where changes are not that swift. Unless ‘ labour \\nlegislations are subjected to frequent revision and not left to continue as they are, they become \\nobsolete and irrelevant. The Indian Labour Legislations are the best example. Most of them have \\nbecome outdated as the required revisions have not been affected and gaps have been created \\nbetween the expectations of industrial so the institution of labour legislation.\\n Example: Labour is a concurrent subject in the Constitution of India implying that both \\nthe Union and the state governments are competent to legislate on labour matters and administer \\nthe same. The bulk of important legislative acts have been enacted by the Parliament.\\n3.1.2 Principles of Social Justice, Social Equality, Social Security, National \\nEconomy and Labour Legislations \\nLabour Legislations contain the principles of social justice, social equity, social security and \\nnational economy in their concept. Social justice implies two things:\\nzl First, equitable distribution of profits and other benefits of industry between owner and \\nworkers. \\nzl Second, providing protection to workers against harmful effect to their health, safety and \\nmorality. \\nSocial equality provides the flexibility in labour legislations to adjust to the need of the industrial \\nsociety. Social security envisages collective action against social risks which constitute the crux \\nof the labour legislation. National Economy provides the standards to be set for the labour \\nlegislations. Human Rights principles and human dignity postulates provide the broader base for \\nthe concept of labour legislations. Thus, these principles are the fundamentals for understanding \\nthe concept of Labour jurisprudence. \\n\\uf026\\nCaselet  Labor Unrest at Toyota India\\nO\\nn January 08, 2006, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Limited (TKM) announced \\nan indefinite lockout of its vehicle manufacturing plant at Bidadi located near \\nBangalore, Karnataka.

The lockout notice stated that the strike was illegal \\nas the Employee Union did not give the mandatory 14 day notice period as per Industrial \\nDisputes Act, 1947. It also stated that the workers were indulging in violence and destruction. \\nTKM was a joint venture, established in 1997, between Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota), \\nJapan’s largest car company and the second-largest car manufacturer in the world, and the \\nKirloskar Group of India. \\nToyota holds an 89% equity stake and while the Kirloskar Group holds the remaining 11%. \\nToyota has invested nearly US$ 336 million (INR 15 billion) in the plant with capacity of \\nproducing 60,000 units per year.  Toyota manufactures its world famous cars like Corolla, \\nCamry and Innova at the plant. The plant had a total workforce of 2,378 out of which \\naround 1,550 employees belonged to the Employee Union. \\nOn January 06, 2006, the Employee Union went on strike with the demand to reinstate \\nthree dismissed employees, ten suspended employees, and improve the work conditions \\nat the plant. These employees had been dismissed and suspended by the company, on \\ndisciplinary rounds, for attacking a supervisor and misconduct. TKM declared that it \\nwould not rehire nor reinstate those employees culminating in the strike and lockout. TKM \\nmade several serious allegations against the Employee Union. \\nThe company said that the striking workers were threatening to blowup LPG gas cylinders \\nin the company premises, obstructing the outward movement of manufactured vehicles, \\nillegally stopping production, and manhandling other workers, who were not part of the \\nEmployee Union, to strike. In response, the Employee Union said that three employees \\nwere dismissed because they were actively participating in trade union activities and the \\ncompany wanted to suppress the trade union. They further said that working conditions at \\nthe plant were inhuman and ‘slave like.\\nThey were often made to stretch their working hours without sufficient relaxation and \\ncompensation. The issue took a new turn when representatives from the management \\nat TKM refused to attend a meeting before the Labor Commissioner on January 09, 2006 \\nfor resolving the dispute with the union. The company said that the atmosphere was not \\nconductive for talks as the Employee Union was in a violent and agitated mood. Though, \\nthe company appealed for two weeks time to appear before the Labor Commissioner so \\nthat situation could become stable, they were given time only till January 12, 2006.  The \\nEmployee Union got support from various trade unions and demanded the intervention of \\nthe state government to help resolve the dispute in their favor. TKM continued with partial \\nproduction of vehicles with the help of non-unionized workers and the management staff, \\nwho were specially trained for these kinds of emergencies.\\nHowever, the company’s output had fallen from 92 vehicles per day to 30 vehicles with an \\nestimated production loss of around INR 700 million. The Company lifted the lockout on \\nJanuary 21, 2006 stating that it was responding to the request from workers who eager to \\nreturn to work. The workers were required to sign a good conduct undertaking to maintain \\ndiscipline and ensure full production. The Employee Union relented and withdrew their \\nstrike following a Government Order on January 21, 2006, which was against the strike and \\nreferred the issue to the third Additional Labor Court. However, the union said that they \\nwould not sign the good conduct declaration specified by TKM. \\nThe unrest had other ramifications as the Toyota spokesperson said that the company \\nwould rethink its recent decision to build a second car manufacturing plant in the state. It \\nwas also felt that this incident would seriously affect the Karnataka Government’s efforts \\nin trying to attract Volkswagen to establish a vehicle manufacturing plant in the state.

The struggle was between two unequal. \\nThe contract between capital and labour could never be struck on equitable terms. The social \\nscientists interpreted this struggle in different ways. The point, however, was to change it. The \\nchange contemplated was one of transforming a slave into partner and thereby bridle the power \\nof capital to impose its own terms on the workmen. \\nVarious factors helped this process to take place. The struggle was not easy. Numerous forces, \\ndirectly and indirectly, hastened the pace facilitating the passing of labour friendly legislation. \\nNotes  The relevance of the dignity of human labour and the need for protecting and \\nsafeguarding the interest of labour as human beings has been enshrined in Chapter-III \\n(Articles 16, 19, 23 & 24) and Chapter IV (Articles 39, 41, 42, 43, 43A & 54) of the Constitution \\nof India keeping in line with Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. \\nLabour is a concurrent subject in the Constitution of India implying that both the Union \\nand the state governments are competent to legislate on labour matters and administer the \\nsame. The bulk of important legislative acts have been enacted by the Parliament.\\n3.2.1 Factors Influencing Labour Legislations\\nFollowing are the factors affecting labour legislations:\\nEarly Exploitative Industrial Society\\nThe origin of labour legislation lies in the excesses of the early industrialism that followed \\nIndustrial Revolution.

Naturally, such excesses \\ncould not have continued for long without protest and without demand for reforms. The early \\nFactories Acts flowed from these excesses and manifested the desire of the community in general \\nto protect its weaker section against exploitation. The workers had very little legal protection \\navailable. Therefore, it can be safely said that the labour legislations are the natural children of \\nindustrial revolution.\\nImpact of Contemporary Events\\nThe impacts of contemporary events are as follows:\\nzl Along with Industrial Revolution, Revolutionary thinking of Rousseau, J.S. Mill, the French \\nRevolution, Hegel, Marx & Engels and Russian Revolution greatly influenced the thought \\nprocesses and hastened the pace of labour jurisprudence. \\nzl The world wars made it possible for the labourers to realise their importance that unless \\nthey produce, it will be difficult for warring nations to win. Therefore, they must stake their \\nclaims for better quality of work life. \\nzl The revolution in science, technology, the communication and telecommunication also \\nhelped in bringing the world, closer. It became easier for the working classes of the \\nunderdeveloped world to know the better conditions of service of their counterparts in the \\ndeveloped world.\\nThe Growth of Trade Unionism\\nThe Trade Union movement, which itself springs from industrial revolution has been another \\nfactor which has quickened the growth of labour legislations. On the one hand, their demands \\nfor protection of the interests of the working class led to legislations in the field of wages, hours \\nof work, women’s compensation, social security and other areas; on the other hand, their growth \\nnecessitated legislations for the regulation of industrial disputes, their prevention and settlement \\nand trade union rights and privileges. Trade unions have been as much conditioned by labour \\nlegislations as they have conditioned them.\\nGrowth of Political Freedom and Extension of Franchise\\nGradual extension and adoption of universal adult suffrage placed in the hands of the working \\nclass, a powerful instrument to influence the cause of state policy. Their representatives started \\nespousing the cause of labour and getting progressive legislations passed. The workers used \\ntheir political powers for betterment and amelioration of their lots.\\nRise of Socialist and other Revolutionary Ideas\\nIn his analysis of capitalism, Marx showed that the exploitation of labour was inherent in the \\ncapitalist economic system. Therefore, he advocated the overthrow of capitalist system. The \\necho of the slogan, “the workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains”, \\nreverberating throughout the capitalist world, sent a shudder among the conservative and \\ncapitalist circles to which ameliorative and protective labour legislations came as safe alternatives. \\nThey readily grasped labour legislations as antidote to the spread’ of revolutionary ideas. The \\nFabian Society of England, the establishment of socialist and communist parties in many countries \\nand first and second internationals strengthened the trend for progressive labour legislations.'),\n",

Early Factories Acts were made possible because of \\nthe efforts of the humanitarians like Hume, Place, Shaftesbury and others. Researches in Social \\nSciences like Sociology, Psychology and Anthropology exploded the myth of the natural elite \\nand gave a powerful push to the movement of social reforms, social change, social justice and \\nlabour legislations. \\nEstablishment of I.L.O. \\nThe establishment of the I.L.O. in 1919 has been a very potent factor in conditioning the \\ncourse of labour legislation all over the world. The acceptance of the principle that “labour is \\nnot a commodity” and the slogan that “Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity \\neverywhere”, have influenced the course of labour legislations in all the countries. The ILO, \\nthrough persistent investigation of workers’ living conditions has continuously established the \\nneed for ameliorative labour legislation. It has initiated proposals for labour legislations, subjected \\nthem to elaborate discussions and reviews and has adopted Conventions and Recommendations. \\nThe ILO by trying to establish uniform labour standards in so far as the diverse conditions and \\nuneven economic developments of the world permit, has done a singular service in the field of \\nlabour legislation. \\nNotes  ILO, through Conventions and Recommendations, have undertaken the \\ntask of creating - international minimum standards of labour which constitute the \\nInternational Labour Code. They cover a wide range of subjects including wages, hours \\nof work, annual holidays with pay, minimum age of employment, medical examination, \\nmaternity protection, industrial health, safety and welfare, social security, freedom of \\nassociation, right to organise and bargain collectively, employment conditions of seamen \\nand unemployment.\\nThe ILO standards have influenced Indian Labour Legislations to a great extent. ILO standards \\nhave formed the sheet-anchor of Indian Labour Legislations, especially after 1946 when Indian \\nNational Government assured office. The Directive Principles of State Policy in Articles 39, 41, \\n42, 43 and 43A of the Constitution, lay down policy objectives in the field of labour having close \\nresemblance and influence to the ILO Constitution and the Philadelphia Charter of 1944. Thus, \\nthe ILO both directly and indirectly has had a great influence on the Indian Labour Scene and \\nLabour Legislation.\\nDid u know?  International Labour Organisation (ILO) was one of the first organisations to \\ndeal with labour issues. The ILO was established as an agency of the League of Nations \\nfollowing the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I. Post-war reconstruction \\nand the protection of labour unions occupied the attention of many nations during and \\nimmediately after World War I. In Great Britain, the Whitley Commission, a subcommittee \\nof the Reconstruction Commission, recommended in its July 1918 Final Report that \\n“industrial councils” be established throughout the world. The British Labour Party had \\nissued its own reconstruction programme in the document titled Labour and the New \\nSocial Order. In February 1918, the third Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference \\n(representing delegates from Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy) issued its report, \\nadvocating an international labour rights body, an end to secret diplomacy, and other'),\n",

No doubt, these legislations were \\nbeneficial to Indian labour but this benefit was incidental to the main purpose, i.e. the protection \\nof the interests of British Capitalists. \\nThe British Civil Servants carried with them the British tradition of democracy and pragmatism. \\nThe Workman Compensation Act, 1923, the Indian Trade Unions Act, 1926, the Payment of \\nWages Act, 1936 etc. followed British pattern \\nThe struggle for national emancipation and adoption of Indian Constitution \\nThe Industrial Workers got support from the freedom struggle and nationalist leaders who \\nmade tireless efforts to get protective labour legislations enacted. The Indian Trade Unions Act, \\nthe appointment of Royal Commission on Labour etc. was because of pressure from freedom \\nstruggle. \\nThe leaders of the national movement had promised the establishment of a better and just social \\norder after independence; which was ultimately embodied in the Preamble, Fundamental Rights \\nand Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution. \\nWe have plethora of labour legislations immediately after independence - \\nzl The Factories Act, 1948 \\nzl The E.S.I. Act, 1948 \\nzl The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 \\nzl Mines Act, 1952 \\nzl Employees P.F.& Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 \\nzl Plantation Labour Act, 1951 \\nzl Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 \\nDid u know?  The legislations can be categorized as follows:\\n1. Labour laws enacted by the Central Government, where the Central Government has \\nthe sole responsibility for enforcement.'),\n",

HMSI was established on August 20, 1999, and a plant was set \\nup at Manesar to manufacture two-wheelers for the Indian market. HMCL made an initial \\ninvestment of ` 3 billion to establish the plant which had an annual production capacity \\nof 200,000.\\nHMSI workers were severely beaten up by the police, and newspapers and TV channels gave \\nwide coverage to the violence of the action. The protest followed six months of simmering \\nlabor unrest at the HMSI factory in which the workers also resorted to job slowdown8(since \\nDecember 2004 when the workers’ demand for an increase in wages was rejected by the \\nHMSI management). With their demands being rejected by the management, the workers \\ntried to form a trade union and this resulted in a confrontation with the management. Fifty \\nworkers of the production team were suspended and four others dismissed in May 2005. \\nApparently there was a show of strength between the management and the workers.\\nWhile the management alleged that the workers were resorting to ‘go-slow’ tactics and \\nwere threatening not to return to work until their colleagues had been reinstated, the \\nworkers alleged that the management was using pressure tactics such as victimization of \\nactive union members and a ‘lock-out’ to break the back of the union.\\nOn July 25, 2005, the workers of the plant were demanding reinstatement of the suspended \\nemployees when some workers allegedly attacked policemen on the plant premises. This \\nled to police intervention and a violent tussle ensued between the police and the workers \\nin which workers protesting peacefully were also beaten up.\\nThe police were reported to have overreacted and it was alleged that they had been \\noverzealous in protecting the interests of the HMSI management, even without any direct \\nrequest from the company’s.\\nFor companies, the incident brought to the fore the need to maintain sound industrial \\nrelations to ensure productive and profitable operations. The management and the \\nworkers traded allegations and counter allegations on what the root cause of the dispute \\nwas. They blamed each other for the situation that ultimately took an ugly turn on July \\n25, 2005. The management held the workers responsible for indiscipline and for slowing \\ndown production, while the workers insisted that there had been no indiscipline on their \\npart and that the management was bringing up this issue only to prevent the formation of \\na trade union at HMSI.\\nSome analysts charged that the incident was fallout of the long-term oppression and \\nmalpractices at the Gurgaon factory by the HMSI management. They alleged that HMSI’s \\nmanagement had violated certain laws relating to the welfare of workers. It was reported \\nthat a worker had allegedly been kicked by a Japanese manager on the shop floor in \\nDecember 2004. The services of four other workers who had come to his rescue were \\nallegedly terminated.\\nContd...'),\n",

The Act extends to the whole of India. Mines and Railways workers are not \\nincluded as they are covered by separate Acts. The new Act addressed the issues of safety, health, \\nand welfare. Many amendments were aimed to keep the Act in tune with the developments in \\nthe field of health and safety. However, it was not until 1987 that the elements of occupational \\nhealth and safety, and prevention and protection of workers employed in hazardous process, got \\ntruly incorporated in the Act.  The purpose of this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend \\nbasic expressions. At the end of this unit you should be able to understand various concepts \\nregarding the basic concept of Factories Act.\\n4.1 Historical Development of Factory Legislation\\nWith the establishment of a Cotton Mills in 1851, and a Jute Mill in Bengal in 1855, modern factory \\nsystem was founded in India. Women and children were employed. There were excessive and \\nlong hours of work with little recreation. The employers used to have their way. In 1881, Indian \\nFactories Act was passed which gave protection to the employees, especially to the children. \\nThe Factory Commission was appointed in 1890 by the Government of India. On the basis of \\nthe recommendations of the Commission an Act was passed in 1891, whereby the definition \\nof Factory was amended to include premises in which fifty persons or more were employed. \\nThe Local Governments were empowered to extend it to premises in which twenty persons or \\nmore were employed. There were provisions about women employees and hours of work for \\nthem were limited with a provision for thirty minute’s interval for rest. The Act was amended \\nfrom time to time. It was amended twice in 1923 and 1926. The Act was thoroughly revised and \\nredrafted in 1934 on the lines of recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Labour, \\nwhich was appointed in 1929.\\nThe Factories Act, 1934, was several times, amended and then the new Act of 1948 was passed. \\nUnder the 1934 Act, Provincial Government had power to apply the Act to the establishments \\nwhere power was used and where more than ten person were employed. It reduced the hours \\nof work and aimed to improve the working condition in factories; provisions were also made for \\nadequate inspection and enforcement of the Act.\\nIn the year 1948, the Factories Act, 1934 was revised and its scope extended to include welfare, \\nhealth, cleanliness, overtime payments and similar measures. The Factories Act was to ensure \\nproper, safe and healthy working conditions in the factories, so that the workers may feel interest \\nand while in factories, devote their time and labour in the working process of the factory without \\nbeing afraid of bodily strain and without fear and danger of accidents. The Act was amended \\nperiodically upto 1976. \\nBy this time a very large number of chemical factories had been set up involving the manufacture \\nand handling of hazardous and toxic chemicals. This brought in more problems of safety and \\nhealth. By the time the Government could assess the possible impact of the problem and foresee \\nthe possibilities of major disasters, the world’s worst tragedy shocked Bhopal wiping out in hours \\nthousands of innocent, ignorant, lives and rendering many more incapacitated. In 1987, Factories \\n(Amendment) Act, 1987 was passed, a memorial to the victims of Bhopal.\\nIt provides better safeguards in the use and handling of hazardous substance in factories. It calls \\nupon the management to provide for greater safety measures (including precautions regarding \\nthe use of portable electric light in the factories), appointment of safety officers in factories where \\n1000 or more workers are employed, or where in any manufacturing process or operation is \\ncarried on, which involves any risk of bodily injury, poisoning or disease, or any other hazard to \\nhealth to the persons employed in the factory.

It applies to all factories including factories belonging to \\nCentral or any State Government unless otherwise excluded. The benefits of this Act are available \\nto persons who are employed in the factory and be covered within the meaning of the term \\n“worker” as defined in the Act.

The legislature has provided that \\nin the case of a factory owned or controlled by any of these authorities the person or \\npersons appointed to manage the affairs of the factory shall be deemed to be the occupier. \\nTherefore, if it is a case of a factory, in fact and in reality, owned or controlled by the Central \\nGovernment or other authority, the person or persons appointed to manage the affairs of \\nthe factory shall have to be deemed to be the occupier even though for better management \\nof such a factory, a corporate form is adopted by the Government.\\nIt was held in the case that the relevant provisions regarding the establishment of the \\nappellant corporation and its working leave no doubt that the ``ultimate control’’ over all \\nthe affairs of the corporation, including opening and running of the factories, is with the \\nCentral Government. Acting through the corporation is only a method employed by the \\nCentral Government for running its petroleum industry.

Therefore salt \\nworks where process of converting seawater into salt is carried on in the open comes within \\n‘premises’ as defined in the Act. [(Ardeshir H. Bhiwandiwala v.

V V Sharma [(1950) 1 LLJ 29] conversion of raw films into a finished product was held \\nto be a manufacturing process. Similarly in New Taj Mahal Cafe Ltd., Mangalore v. Inspector \\nof Factories, Mangalore, 1956 1 LLJ 273 the preparation of foodstuffs and other eatable in the \\nkitchen of a restaurant and use of a refrigerator for treating or adapting any article with a view to \\nits sale were also held to be manufacturing process.\\n3. Worker\\nSection 2 (1) of the Factories Act 1,948 defines a “worker” to mean:\\nA person employed, directly or through any agency (including a contractor) with or without \\nknowledge of principal employer, whether for remuneration or not, in any manufacturing \\nprocess, or in cleaning any part of the machinery or premises used for a manufacturing process \\nor in any other kind of work incidental to, or connected with, the manufacturing process, or the \\nsubject of the manufacturing process but does not include any member of the armed forces of \\nthe union.\\nBroadly speaking, therefore, worker is a person:\\nzl who is employed; \\nzl who is employed either directly or through any agency; \\nzl who is employed in any manufacturing process, or in clearing any part of the machinery \\nor premises used for a manufacturing process or in any other kind of work incidental to, or \\nconnected with the manufacturing process or the subject of the manufacturing process. \\nIf the aforesaid conditions are satisfied, then it is immaterial whether a person was employed for \\nremuneration or not.\\nIn Chintaman Rao v State of Madhya Pradesh, [AIR 1958 All 44] the factory entered into contracts \\nwith independent contractors known as sattedars. The sattedars were supplied tobacco by the \\nfactories and, in some cases, bidi leaves also. The sattedars were neither bound to work in the \\nfactory nor were they bound to prepare the bidis themselves but could get them prepared by \\nothers. In fact they engaged coolies for rolling bidis and made payments to them. They used \\nto collect bidis from these coolies and take them to the factory where the bidis were sorted and \\nchecked by the workers of the factory. The factory made payments to the sattedars for work of \\nrolling bidis. The Supreme Court gave the restricted meaning to words “directly or through any \\nagency” in Section 2(l) and held that (i) worker was a person employed by the management and \\n(ii) there must be a contract of service and a relationship of master and servant between them. On \\nthe facts of the case the Supreme Court held that the sattedars were independent contractors and \\nthey and the coolies engaged by them for rolling bidis were not workers.\\n Example: In State of Kerala v V M Patel, [1961(1) LLJ 549 (SC)] the Supreme Court held \\nthat the work of garbling pepper by winnowing, cleaning, washing and drying in lime and laid \\nout to dry in a warehouse are manufacturing processes and therefore the persons employed in \\nthese processes were workers within the meaning of Section 2(I) of the Act. \\nIn Shankar Balaji Waje v. State of Maharashtra, [AIR 1957 SC 517] Pandurang was engaged \\nfor rolling bidis. Although the hours of work were fixed but there was no obligation to attend \\nduring those hours. There was freedom to come and go. There was neither faxed salary nor \\nactual supervision on the work. Payment was made on the quantum of work. The Supreme Court \\nheld that such person were not workers because there was no control and the supervision over \\npandurang.'),\n",

The fear of penalty and \\npunishment is bound to make the board of directors of the company more vigilant and \\nresponsive to the need to carry out various obligations and duties under the Act, particularly \\nin regard to the safety and welfare of the workers.\\nProviso (ii) was introduced by the Amending Act couched in a mandatory form - “any one \\nof the directors shall be deemed to be the occupier” - keeping in view the experience gained \\nover the years as to how the directors of a company managed to escape their liability for \\nvarious breaches and defaults committed in the factory by putting up another employee \\nas a shield and nominating him as the ‘occupier’ who would willingly suffer penalty and \\npunishment.\\nIt was held that where the company owns or runs a factory, it is the company which is \\nin the ultimate control of the affairs of the factory through its directors. Even where the \\nresolution of the board says that an officer or employee other than one of the directors shall \\nhave ultimate control over the affairs of the factory, it would only be a camouflage or an \\nartful circumvention because the ultimate control cannot be transferred from that of the \\ncompany to one of its employees or officers, except where there is a complete transfer of \\nthe control of the affairs of the factory.\\nAn occupier of the factory in the case of a company must necessarily be any of its directors \\nwho shall be so notified for the purposes of the Factories Act. Such an occupier cannot \\nbe any other employee of the company or the factory. This interpretation of an ‘occupier’ \\nwould apply to all provisions of the Act wherever the expression `occupier’ is used, and \\nnot merely for the purposes of Sec. 7 or Sec. 7A of the Act.\\nThe Supreme Court further held that proviso (ii) is not ultravires the main provision of Sec. \\n2(n) and, as a matter of fact, there is no conflict at all between the main provision of Sec. \\n2(n) and proviso (ii) thereto. Both can be read harmoniously and when so read in the case \\nof a company, the occupier of a factory owned by a company would mean any one of the \\ndirectors of the company who has been notified/identified by the company to have ultimate \\ncontrol over the affairs of the factory. And where no such director has been identified, then, \\nfor the purposes of prosecution and punishment under the Act, the Inspector of Factories \\nmay initiate proceedings against anyone of the directors as the deemed occupier.\\nThe Supreme Court further held that there is nothing unreasonable in fixing the liability on \\na director of a company and making him responsible for compliance with the provisions \\nof the Act and the rules made thereunder and laying down that if there is contravention \\nunder of the provisions of the Act or an offence is committed under the Act the notified \\ndirector and, in the absence of the notification, anyone of the directors of the company shall \\nbe prosecuted and shall be liable to be punished as the deemed occupier.\\nThe restriction imposed by proviso (ii), if at all it may be called a restriction, has a direct \\nnexus with the object sought to be achieved and is, therefore, a reasonable restriction within \\nthe meaning of clause (6) of Article 19. Proviso (ii) to Sec. 2 (n) is thus not ultravires Article \\n19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nQuestions:\\n1. Study and analyze the case.\\n2. Write down the case facts.\\n3.

Based on the experiences of \\nTrade Disputes Act, 1929 and usefulness of rule 81 (a) of the Defence of India Rules, the bill \\npertaining to Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 embodied the essential principles of rule 81 (a) which \\nwas acceptable to both employers and workers retaining most parts of the provisions of Trade \\nDisputes Act, 1929. This legislation is designed to ensure industrial peace by recourse to a given \\nform of procedure and machinery for investigation and settlement of industrial disputes. Its main \\nobjective is to provide for a just and equitable settlement of disputes by negotiations, conciliation, \\ndedication, voluntary arbitration and adjudication instead of by trial of strength through strikes \\nand lock-outs.  As State Governments are free to have their own labour laws, States like UP., MP., \\nGujarat and Maharashtra have their own legislation for settlement of disputes in their respective \\nstates. U.P. legislation is known as U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, while others have Industrial \\nRelations Act more or less on the lines of ‘Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946. The purpose of'),\n",

At the end of this unit you \\nshould be able to understand various concepts regarding Industrial Disputes Act.\\n5.1 Definitions\\nAs per Section 2(k) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, an industrial dispute in defined as any \\ndispute or difference between employers and employers, or between employers and workmen, \\nor between workmen and which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the \\nterms of employment or with the conditions of labor, of any person.\\nThis definition includes all the aspects of a dispute. It, not only includes the disagreement \\nbetween employees and employers, but also emphasizes the difference of opinion between \\nworker and worker. The disputes generally arise on account of poor wage structure or poor \\nworking conditions. This disagreement or difference could be on any matter concerning the \\nworkers individually or collectively. It must be connected with employment or non-employment \\nor with the conditions of labor.\\nThe Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 recognizes certain rights to the employees employed by the \\nemployer. For the purposes of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, workman has been defined as \\nunder:\\n“Workman means any person (including an apprentice) employed in any industry to do any \\nmanual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward, \\nwhether the terms of employment be express or implied, and for the purposes of any proceeding \\nunder this Act in relation to an industrial dispute, includes any such person who has been \\ndismissed, discharged or retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of, that dispute, \\nor whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute, but does not include any \\nsuch person:\\nzl who is subject to the Air Force Act, 1950 (45 of 1950), or the Army Act, 1950 (46 of 1950), or \\nthe Navy Act, 1957 (62 of 1957); or\\nzl who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a prison; or\\nzl who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity; or\\nzl who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, draws wages exceeding one thousand six \\nhundred rupees per mensem or exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached to the \\noffice or by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of a managerial nature.\\nNotes  From the point of view of the employer, an industrial dispute resulting in \\nstoppage of work means a stoppage of production. This results in increase in the average \\ncost of production since fixed expenses continue to be incurred. It also leads to a fall in \\nsales and the rate of turnover, leading to a fall in profits. The employer may also be liable to \\ncompensate his customers with whom he may have contracted for regular supply. Apart \\nfrom the immediate economic effects, loss of prestige and credit, alienation of the labor \\nforce, and other non-economic, psychological and social consequences may also arise. Loss \\ndue to destruction of property, personal injury and physical intimidation or inconvenience \\nalso arises.\\nFor the employee, an industrial dispute entails loss of income. The regular income by way of \\nwages and allowance ceases, and great hardship may be caused to the worker and his family. \\nEmployees also suffer from personal injury if they indulge into strikes n picketing; and the \\npsychological and physical consequences of forced idleness. The threat of loss of employment in \\ncase of failure to settle the dispute advantageously, or the threat of reprisal action by employers \\nalso exists.'),\n",

These laws apply only to the organised sector. Consequently, \\nthese laws have restricted labour mobility, have led to capital-intensive methods in the organised \\nsector and adversely affected the sector’s long-run demand for labour. Labour being a subject in \\nthe concurrent list, State-level labour regulations are also an important determinant of industrial \\nperformance. Evidence suggests that States, which have enacted more pro-worker regulations, \\nhave lost out on industrial production in general. \\nThe Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947. Particular attention has been paid to its Chapter V-B, \\nintroduced by an amendment in 1976, which required firms employing 300 or more workers to \\nobtain government permission for layoffs, retrenchments and closures. A further amendment in \\n1982 (which took effect in 1984) expanded its ambit by reducing the threshold to 100 workers. It is \\nargued that since permission is difficult to obtain, employers are reluctant to hire workers whom \\nthey cannot easily get rid of.\\n!\\nCaution  Job security laws thus protect a tiny minority of workers in the organised \\nsector and prevent the expansion of industrial employment that could benefit the mass \\nof workers outside. It is also argued that the restriction on retrenchment has adversely \\naffected workplace discipline, while the threshold set at 100 has discouraged factories from \\nexpanding to economic scales of production, thereby harming productivity.\\nSeveral other sections of the IDA allegedly have similar effects, because they increase workers’ \\nbargaining strength and thereby raise labour costs either directly through wages or indirectly by \\ninhibiting work reorganization in response to changes in demand and technology. The Act also \\nlays down.\\n5.2.1 Objectives of Industrial Disputes Act\\nFollowing are the objectives of Industrial Disputes Act:\\nzl promotion of measures for securing amity and good relations between employer and \\nworkmen\\nzl Investigation and settlement of industrial disputes \\nzl Prevention of illegal strike and lock-outs \\nzl Relief to workmen in the matter of lay-off, retrenchment and closure of an undertaking \\nzl Promotion of Collective Bargaining \\n5.2.2 Scope and Coverage of Industrial Disputes Act\\nThe Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, extends to the whole of India, and is applicable to all industrial \\nestablishments employing one or more workmen. It covers all employees both technical and non-\\ntechnical, and also supervisors drawing salaries and wages upto ` 1600 per month. It excludes \\npersons employed in managerial and administrative capacities and workmen subject to Army Act, \\nNavy Act, Air Force Act and those engaged in police, prison and civil services of the Government. \\nAs regards disputes, it covers only collective disputes or disputes supported by trade unions or \\nby substantial number of workers and also individual disputes relating to termination of service. \\nFor purposes of this act the term “dispute” is defined as dispute or difference between employers'),\n",

This may be regarded as one of-the phases \\nof collective bargaining and extension of process of mutual negotiation under the guidance of a \\nthird party, i.e. Conciliation Officer, or a Board of Conciliation appointed by the Government. \\nBoth the Central and State Governments are -empowered under the Industrial Disputes Act, \\n1947 to appoint such number of conciliation officers as may be considered necessary for specified \\nareas or for specified industries in specified areas either permanently or for limited periods.\\nNotes  The main duty of a Conciliation Officer is to investigate and promote settlement \\nof disputes. He has wide discretion and may do all such things, as he may deem fit to bring \\nabout settlement of disputes. His role is only advisory and mediatory. He has no authority \\nto make a final decision or to pass formal order directing the parties to act in a particular \\nmanner.\\nProcess of Conciliation\\nWhere any industrial dispute exists or is apprehended, and is brought to the notice of conciliation \\nofficer by the parties concerned, or is referred to him by the government, or he receives a notice \\nof strike or lock-out, he is to hold conciliation proceedings in the prescribed manner.

In such cases conciliation proceedings are deemed to have commenced \\nfrom the time the notice of strike is received by the conciliation officer. In other cases conciliation \\nmay be initiated at the discretion of the Government. The conciliation officer’ may send formal \\nintimation to the parties concerned declaring his intention to commence conciliation proceedings \\nwith effect from the date he may specify. He may hold meetings with the parties to the dispute \\neither jointly or separately. \\nA joint meeting saves time and also affords parties an opportunity to meet each other and put \\nforward their respective view points and comments about the dispute. Conciliation proceedings \\nare to be conducted expeditiously in a manner considered fit by the conciliation officer for the \\ndischarge of his duties imposed on him by the Act, If a settlement is arrived at in the course of \\nthe conciliation proceedings, memorandum of settlement is worked out and signed by the parties \\nconcerned, and it becomes then binding on all parties concerned for a period agreed upon.\\nThe conciliation officer is to send a report to the Government giving full facts along with a copy \\nof the settlement. If no agreement is arrived at, the-conciliation- officer is required to submit a full \\nreport to the Government explaining the causes of failure.\\nAfter considering the failure report the Government may refer the dispute to the Board of \\nConciliation, arbitration, or for adjudication to Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal. If the \\nGovernment does not make such a reference, it shall record and communicate to the parties \\nconcerned the reasons thereof. While exercising its discretion, the Government must act in a \\nbonafide manner and on consideration of relevant matters and facts. The reasons must be such as \\nto show that the question was carefully and properly considered. The conciliation officer has to \\nsend his report within 14 days of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, and this period \\nmay be extended as may be agreed upon by the parties in writing. \\nThe conciliation officer is not the judicial officer. After reporting that no settlement could be \\narrived at, he cannot be debarred from, making fresh effort to bring about a settlement. But he \\ncannot take final decision by himself.\\nPowers of Conciliation Officer\\nUnder the Act, conciliation is not a judicial activity. It is only administrative, since it is executed \\nby the Government agency. Although conciliation officer is not a judicial officer, but to enable \\nhim to discharge his duties cast upon him under the Act, he has been empowered to enter the \\npremises occupied by an establishment to which the dispute relates after giving reasonable \\nnotice for inspecting same, or any of its machinery, appliances or articles. He can also interrogate \\nany person there in respect of any thing situated therein or any matter relevant to the subject \\nmatter of conciliation. He can also call for any document which he has ground for considering \\nrelevant in the dispute, or to be., necessary for the purposes of verifying the implementation of \\nany award or carrying out any other duty imposed on him under the Act. He is also empowered \\nto enforce the attendance of any person for the purpose of examination of such persons. For all \\nthese purposes the conciliation officer shall have the same power as are vested in a Civil Court \\nunder the Code of Civil Procedure. He is also deemed to be public servant within the meaning of \\nSec. 21 of the Indian Penal Code.\\nSettlements In and Outside Conciliation\\nA settlement arrived at in proceedings under the Act is binding on all the parties to the dispute. \\nIt is also binding on other parties if they are summoned to appear in conciliation proceedings as \\nparties to the dispute: In case of employer such a settlement is also binding on his heirs, successors, \\nassigns in respect of establishment to which these dispute relate.

(Section 18).\\nBoard of Conciliation\\nThis is a higher forum which is constituted for a specific dispute. It is not a permanent institution \\nfake the Conciliation Officer, The Government may, as occasion arises, constitute a Board of \\nConciliation for settlement of an industrial dispute with an independent chairman and equal \\nrepresentatives of the parties concerned as its members. . The chairman, who is appointed by the \\nGovernment, is to be a person unconnected with the dispute or with any industry directly affected \\nby such dispute. Other members are to be appointed on the recommendations of the parties \\nconcerned; and if any party fails to make recommendation, the Government shall appoint such \\npersons as it thinks fit to represent that party. The Board cannot admit a dispute in conciliation on \\nits own. It can act only when reference is made to it by the Government. (Section 5). \\nNotes  As soon as a dispute is referred to a Board, it has to endeavour to bring about \\na settlement of the same. For this purpose, it has to investigate the dispute and all matters \\naffecting the merits and right settlement thereof, for the purpose of inducing the parties to \\ncome to a fair and amicable settlement. Procedure followed by the Board in this regard is \\nalmost the same as adopted by the conciliation officers. The Board is, however, required to \\nsubmit its report within two months of the date on which the dispute was referred to it, or \\nwithin such short period as the Government may fix in this behalf. The proceedings before \\nthe Board are to be held in public, but the Board may at any stage direct that any witness \\nshall be examined or proceedings shall be held in camera.\\nIf a settlement is arrived at, a report with a copy of the settlement is submitted, to the Government. \\nIf the Board fails to bring about settlement, a report is submitted to the Government stating \\nthe facts and circumstances, the steps taken, reasons for failure along with its findings. After \\nconsidering its findings the Government may refer the dispute for voluntary arbitration if both \\nthe parties to the dispute agree for the same, or for Adjudication to Labour Court or Industrial \\nTribunal or National Tribunal. There period of submission of report may be extended by the \\nGovernment beyond two months as agreed upon by the parties in writing. A member of the Board \\nmay record any minute of dissent from the report, or from any recommendation made therein. \\nWith the minute of dissent the report shall be published by, the Government within thirty days \\nfrom the receipt thereof. A Board of Conciliation can only try to bring about a settlement. It has \\nno power to impose a settlement on the parties to the dispute. The Board has the power of a Civil \\nCourt for, (i) enforcing the attendance of any person and examining on oath; (ii) compelling the \\nproduction of documents and material objects; (iii) issuing commissions for the examination of \\nwitnesses. The enquiry or investigation by the Board is regarded as judicial proceedings. \\nThe Boards of conciliation are rarely appointed by the Government these days. The original \\nintention was that major disputes should be referred to a Board and minor disputes shout be \\nhandled by the conciliation officers. In practice, however, it was found that when the Parties \\nto the dispute could not come to an agreement between themselves, their representatives on \\nthe Board in association with independent chairman (unless latter had the role of an umpire or \\narbitrator), could rarely arrive at a settlement. The much more flexible procedure followed by \\nthe conciliation officer is found to be more acceptable. This is more so when disputes relate to a \\nwhole industry, or important issues, and a senior officer of the Industrial Relations Machinery, \\ni.e. a senior officer of the Directorate of Labour, is entrusted with the work of conciliation. \\nThe Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) or Labour Commissioner of the State Government \\ngenerally intervene themselves in conciliation when important issues form the subject matters \\nof the dispute.'),\n",

It has to submit its report within six months on the matter referred to Units.  \\n(Sec. 6). \\n5.4.2 Voluntary Arbitration\\nWhen Conciliation Officer or Board of Conciliation fails to resolve conflict/dispute, parties can be \\nadvised to agree to voluntary arbitration for settling their dispute. For settlement of differences \\nor conflicts between two parties, arbitration is an age old practice in India. The Panchayat system \\nis based on this concept. In the industrial sphere, voluntary arbitration originated at Ahmedabad \\nin the textile industry under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi. Provision for it was made under \\nthe Bombay Industrial Relations Act by the Bombay Government along with the provision \\nfor adjudication, since this was fairly popular in the Bombay region in the 40s and 50s. The \\nGovernment of India has also been emphasizing the importance of voluntary arbitration’ for \\nsettlement of disputes in the labour policy chapter in the first three plan documents, and has \\nalso been advocating this step as an essential feature of collective bargaining. This was also \\nincorporated in the Code of Discipline in Industry adopted at the 15th Indian Labour Conference \\nin 1958. Parties were enjoined to adopt voluntary arbitration without any reservation. The position \\nwas reviewed in 1962 at the session of the Indian Labour Conference where it was agreed that \\nthis ‘step would be the normal method after conciliation effort fails, except when the employer \\nfeels that for some reason he would prefer adjudication. In the Industrial Trade Resolution also \\nwhich was adopted at the time of Chinese aggression, voluntary arbitration was accepted as a \\nmust in all matters of disputes. The Government had thereafter set up a National Arbitration \\nBoard for making the measure popular in all the states, and all efforts are being made to sell this \\nidea to management and employees and their unions. \\nIn 1956 the Government decided to place voluntary arbitration as one of the measures for \\nsettlement of a dispute through third party intervention under the law. Sec. 10A was added to \\nthe Industrial Disputes Act, and it was enforced from 10th March, 1957. \\nReference of Disputes for Arbitration\\nWhere a dispute exists or is apprehended, it can be referred for arbitration if the parties to the \\ndispute agree to do so by submitting a written agreement to that effect, mentioning the person \\nacceptable to them as arbitrator and also the issues to be decided in arbitration - proceedings, to \\nthe Government and the Conciliation Officer concerned before it is referred for adjudication to \\nLabour Court or Tribunal. The Agreement must be signed by both the parties. Both under Sec. \\n10A and 10(2) reference is obligatory. \\nWhere an agreement provides for even number of arbitrators, it will provide for the appointment \\nof another person as an Umpire who shall decide upon the reference if the arbitrators are divided \\nin their opinion. The award of the Umpire shall be deemed to be the arbitration award for the \\npurposes of the Act. \\nThe appropriate Government shall within one month from the date of the receipt of the copy of \\nthe arbitration agreement publish the same in the Official Gazette if the Government is satisfied \\nthat the parties, who have signed the agreement for arbitration, represent majority of each party; \\notherwise it can reject the request for arbitration. \\nWhere any such notification has been issued, the employer and workmen who are not parties \\nto the arbitration agreement, but are concerned in the dispute, shall be given an opportunity to \\npresent their case before the arbitrator or arbitrators.'),\n",

Such an award is also binding on all, employees at the time of award, or to \\nbe employed subsequently even if they are not party to the initial agreement. If the arbitration \\nagreement is not notified in the Official Gazette under Sec. 10A, it is applicable only to the parties \\nwho have agreed to refer the dispute for arbitration. \\nArbitration Award is enforceable in the same manner as the adjudication award of Labour Court \\nor Industrial Tribunal. \\nArbitration is an alternative-to adjudication and the two cannot be used simultaneously. It is \\nvoluntary at the discretion of the parties to a dispute. Arbitrator is a quasi-judicial body. He is an \\nindependent person and has all the attributes of a statutory arbitrator. He has wide freedom, but \\nhe must function within the limit of his powers. He must follow due procedure of giving notice \\nto parties, giving fair hearings, relying upon all available evidence and documents. There must \\nbe no violation of the principles of natural justice.\\nAcceptance of Arbitration\\nVoluntary arbitration has been recommended and given place in law by the Government. \\nExperience, however, shows that although the step has been strongly pressed by the Government \\nfor over thirty years it has yet to take roots. During the last decade not even 1% of the disputes \\nreported were referred for arbitration. The National, Commission on Labour examined the \\nworking of arbitration as a method of settling disputes, and found that it was yet to be accepted \\nby the parties, particularly by the ‘employers, unreservedly. The main hurdles noticed yet are: \\nzl Choice of suitable arbitrator acceptable to both parties. \\nzl Payment of-arbitration-fees-Unions can seldom afford to share such costs equally with \\nmanagement. \\nApart from these, it appears that arbitration under the Act is not correctly understood by the \\nemployers and trade unions. When arbitration is suggested, the impression often is that matter is \\nto be left to the sole decision of an individual who can act in any manner he likes. The sanctity of \\nthe decision by an arbitrator is also held in doubt. The fact that law covers voluntary arbitration, \\nand places it almost parallel to adjudication, is not appreciated or known widely. \\n!\\nCaution  Undoubtedly an arbitrator can give a decision more promptly and enjoys greater \\nfreedom since he is not bound by fetters of law and procedure. He is also not required \\nto only interpret the technicality and meaning of statutory provisions. He is required in \\nfact to decide the issue on grounds of natural justice and fair play to both the parties. \\nArbitration if accepted voluntarily and not under any duress or pressure, should provide a \\nmore wholesome answer. It, however, is for the parties to give a trial to this measure.\\n5.4.3 Adjudication\\nUnlike conciliation and arbitration, adjudication is compulsory method of resolving conflict. \\nThe Industrial Disputes Act provides the machinery for adjudication, namely, Labour Courts, \\nIndustrial Tribunals and National Tribunals.

(Section 7). \\nIndustrial Tribunal\\nThis is also one-man body (Presiding Officer). The Third Schedule of the Act mentions matters \\nof industrial disputes which can be referred to it for adjudication. This Schedule shows that \\nIndustrial Tribunal has wider jurisdiction than the Labour Court. The Government concerned \\nmay appoint two assessors to advise the Presiding Officer in the proceedings. (Section 7A). \\nNational Tribunal\\nThis is the third adjudicatory body to be appointed by the Central Government under the Act for \\nthe reasons already mentioned above. It can deal with any dispute mentioned in Schedule II and \\nIII of the Act or any matter which is not specified therein. This also consists of one person to be \\nappointed by the Central Government, and he must have been a Judge of a High Court. He may \\nalso be assisted by two assessors appointed by the Government to advise him in adjudicating \\ndisputes.\\nThe presiding officers of the above three adjudicatory bodies must be independent persons and \\nshould not have attained the age of 65 years. Again, these three bodies are not hierarchical. It is \\nthe prerogative of the Government to refer a dispute to these bodies. They are under the control \\nof the labour department of the respective State Government and the Central Government. The \\ncontending parties cannot refer any dispute for adjudication themselves, and the awards of these \\nbodies are binding on them. (Section 7B). \\nReference of Dispute for Adjudication (Section 10) \\nIf a dispute is not settled by direct negotiation, or conciliation, if the parties do not agree to get it \\nsettled by voluntary arbitration, the Government at its discretion may refer it to Labour Court, \\nIndustrial Tribunal or National Tribunal, depending upon whether the matter of the dispute \\nappears in the Second or Third Schedule of the Act. However, if the parties to the dispute jointly \\nor separately apply for a reference to Labour Court or Tribunal, the Government is obliged to \\nmake a reference accordingly if it is satisfied that the persons applying represent the majority of \\neach party. Disputes which are considered vexatious or frivolous, are not referred to adjudication. \\nThe Government has also the power to refer disputes which have not taken place, but are only \\napprehended. After referring the dispute to adjudication the Government can prohibit the \\ncontinuance of any strike or lock-out in connection with such dispute which may be in existence \\non the date of its reference. \\nAn order referring a dispute to Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal or National Tribunal shall \\nspecify the period within which they shall submit their award on such dispute to the Government \\nconcerned.

Not a few employers also started questioning the credibility of the presiding officers \\nof the Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals, who are generally retired persons engaged on \\nyearly contract basis. Some trade union leaders now prefer to get disputes settled by pressurised \\nbargaining rather than by adjudication. Quite a number of disputes are reported to be pending \\nwith Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals for four or five years, and for still longer periods in \\nHigh Courts and the Supreme Court. It, therefore, appears that the machinery provided by the \\nIndustrial Disputes Act is failing to cope with demand made on it. Its record shows that is far \\nfrom successful in resolving conflict effectively. This may be due to red-tapism and bureaucratic \\ndelays and complicated procedure which are inherent in the Government organisation. Such \\ndelays have encouraged militancy or violence in management and union relations. \\nThe Industrial Disputes Act as amended recently (Act 46 of 1982), provides time limits for \\nthe disposal of disputes by Labour Courts and Tribunals, but these time limits are observed \\nrarely. The amended Act also provides for setting up machinery- within the establishment for \\nprompt handling of grievances, but this amendment has yet to be given effect to. Over thirty \\nyears back, National Commission on Labour recommended setting up of more independent \\nmachinery in the form of Industrial Relations Commissions, and this recommendation is still \\nunder the consideration of the Government.

Textiles – Industrial Disputes Resolution System  \\n under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947\\nV\\n.J. Textiles is a leading industry having a workforce of more than 1,200 employees, \\nengaged in manufacturing cotton yarn of different counts. The Company has a \\nwell-established distribution network in different parts of the country. It has \\nmodernized all its plants, with a view to improve the productivity and maintain quality. \\nTo maintain good human relations in the plants and the organization as a whole, it has \\nextended all possible facilities to the employees. Compared to other mills, the employees \\nof V J. Industries are enjoying higher wages and other benefits. The Company has a Chief \\nexecutive, followed by executives’ in-charge of different functional areas. The Industrial \\nRelations Department is headed by the Industrial Relations Manager. \\nThe employees are represented by five trade unions — A, B, C, D and E (unions are \\nalphabetically presented based on membership) — out of which the top three unions are \\nrecognized by the management for purposes of negotiations. All the unions have maintained \\ngood relations with the management, both individually and collectively. For the past ten \\nyears, the Company has been distributing bonus to the workers at rates more than the \\nstatutory minimum prescribed under the Bonus Act. Last year, for declaration of the rate of \\nbonus, the management had a series of discussions with all recognized unions and finally \\nannounced a bonus which was, in turn, agreed upon by all the recognized unions. The very \\nnext day when the management prepared the settlement and presented it before the union \\nrepresentatives, while Unions A and C signed the same, the leader of Union B refused to do \\nso and walked out, stating that the rate of bonus declared was not sufficient. The next day \\nUnion B issued a strike notice to the management asking for higher bonus. \\nThe management tried its best to avoid the unpleasant situation, but in vain. As a result, \\nthe members of Union B went on strike. They were joined by the members of Union D also. \\nDuring the strike, the management found that leader of Union A, soon after the first meeting, \\nhad stated in the presence of a group of workers, “lt is because of me that the management \\nhas agreed to declare this much amount of bonus to the employees; Union B has miserably \\nfailed in its talks with the management for want of initiative and involvement”. This \\nobservation somehow reached the leader of Union B as a result of which he felt insulted. \\nSoon after identifying the reason for Union B’s strike call, the Industrial Relations Manager \\nbrought about a compromise between the leaders of Unions A and B. Immediately after \\nthis meeting, the strikers (members of Unions B and D) resumed work and the settlement \\nwas signed for the same rate of bonus as was originally agreed upon. \\nQuestions:\\n1. Was the leader of Union A justified in making remarks which made the leader of \\nUnion B feel offended?\\n2. What should be management’s long-term strategy for avoiding recurrence of inter \\nunion differences on such issues?\\n3. If you were the Industrial Relations Manager, what would you have done had the \\nUnion B resorted to strike for a reason other than that mentioned in the case?\\nSource: http://www.phindia.com/srm/Real-Time-Chap-07.pdf'),\n",

The Payment of Wages Act, 1936 \\nis a central legislation which has been enacted to regulate the payment of wages to workers \\nemployed in certain specified industries and to ensure a speedy and effective remedy to them \\nagainst illegal deductions and/or unjustified delay caused in paying wages to them. It applies \\nto the persons employed in a factory, industrial or other establishment or in a railway, whether \\ndirectly or indirectly, through a sub-contractor. Further, the Act is applicable to employees \\ndrawing wages upto ` 1600 a month. The Central Government is responsible for enforcement of \\nthe Act in railways, mines, oilfields and air transport services, while the State Governments are \\nresponsible for it in factories and other industrial establishments. The purpose of this Unit is to \\nenable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you should be able \\nto understand various concepts regarding the payment of wages to workers.\\n6.1 Definitions\\nPrior to 1936, there was no law regarding the regulation of payment to workmen. It was as early \\nas 1925 that a Private Bill called the “Weekly Payment Bill” was for the first time introduced in the \\nLegislative Assembly. The Bill was, however withdrawn on an assurance from the Government \\nthat the matter was under active consideration of the Government at that time. This was an \\nattempt to remedy some of the evils like delay in payment of wages, non-payment of wages, \\ndeductions made from wages on account of fines imposed by the employer etc. For the purpose \\nof this Act:\\n(a) industrial establishment means any tramway or motor omnibus service; air transport \\nservice; dock, wharf or jetty, inland vessel mechanically propelled; mine, quarry or oil \\nfield; plantation; workshop or other establishment in which articles are produced, adapted \\nor manufactured with a view to there use, transport or sale; establishment in which any \\nwork relating to the construction, development or maintenance of buildings, roads, bridges \\nor canals, or relating to operations connected with navigation, irrigation or the supply of \\nwater, or relating to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity or any other \\nform of power is being carried on;\\n(b) wages means all remuneration’s (whether by way of salary, allowance or otherwise) \\nexpressed in terms of money or capable of being so expressed which would, if the terms \\nof employment, express or implied, were fulfilled, be payable to a person employed in \\nrespect of his employment or of work done in such employment, and include :\\n(i) any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or \\norder of a Court;\\n(ii) any remuneration to which the person employed is entitled in respect of overtime \\nwork or holidays or any leave period;\\n(iii) any additional remuneration payable under the terms of employment (whether \\ncalled a bonus or by any other name);\\n(iv) any sum by reason of the termination of employment of the person employed is \\npayable under any law contract or instrument which provides for the payment of \\nsuch sum, whether with or without deductions, but does not provide for the time \\nwithin which the payment is to be made; \\n(v) any sum to which the person employed is entitled under any scheme framed under \\nany law for the time being in force; but does not include:\\nz\\x8d any bonus (whether under a scheme of profit sharing or otherwise) which \\ndoes not form part of the remuneration payable under terms of employment'),\n",

T.S. Kelawala and Ors\\nI\\nn the case of Bank of India v. T.S. Kelawala and Ors., the question which came for \\nconsideration was that whether an employer has a right to deduct wages unilaterally \\nand without holding an enquiry for the period the employees go on strike or resort to \\ngo-slow. The appellant in this case is a nationalized bank. The demands for wage-revision \\nmade by the employees of all the banks were pending at the relevant time, and in support \\nof the said demands the All India Bank Employees’ Association had given a call for a \\ncountrywide strike. \\nThe appellant-Bank issued a circular to all its managers and agents to deduct wages of the \\nemployees who would participate in the strike for the days they go on strike. The Bank \\nissued an Administrative Circular warning the employee that they would be committing \\na breach of their contract of service if they participated in the strike and that they would \\nnot be entitled to draw the salary for the full day if they did so, and consequently, they \\nneed not report for work for the rest of the working hours on that day. The court held that, \\nSection 7 (2) read with Section 9 of the Payment of Wages Act provides the circumstances \\nunder which and the extent to which deduction can be made. It is only when the employer \\nhas right to make deduction, resort should be had to the act to ascertain the extent to \\nwhich the deduction can be made. No deduction exceeding the limit provided by the act \\nis permissible even if the contract so provides. There cannot be contract contrary to or in \\nterms wider than the input of sections 7 and 9 of the act. Therefore wage deduction cannot \\nbe made under section 7(2) of the Payment of Wages Act if there is no such power to the \\nemployer under the terms of contract.\\nSource: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1593043\\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n1.

The person responsible for payment of wages shall fix the wage period upto which wage \\npayment is to be made. No wage-period shall exceed one month.\\n2. All wages shall be paid in current legal tender, that is, in current coin or currency notes or \\nboth. However, the employer may, after obtaining written authorisation of workers, pay \\nwages either by cheque or by crediting the wages in their bank accounts.\\n3. All payment of wages shall be made on a working day. In railways, factories or industrial \\nestablishments employing less than 1000 persons, wages must be paid before the expiry \\nof the seventh day after the last date of the wage period. In all other cases, wages must be \\npaid before the expiry of the tenth day after the last day of the wage period. However, the \\nwages of a worker whose services have been terminated shall be paid on the next day after \\nsuch termination.\\n4. Although the wages of an employed person shall be paid to him without deductions of \\nany kind, the Act allows deductions from the wages of an employee on the account of \\nthe following:- (i) fines; (ii) absence from duty; (iii) damage to or loss of goods expressly \\nentrusted to the employee; (iv) housing accommodation and amenities provided by the \\nemployer; (v) recovery of advances or adjustment of over-payments of wages; (vi) recovery \\nof loans made from any fund constituted for the welfare of labour in accordance with \\nthe rules approved by the State Government, and the interest due in respect thereof; (vii) \\nsubscriptions to and for repayment of advances from any provident fund; (viii) income-tax; \\n(ix) payments to co-operative societies approved by the State Government or to a scheme \\nof insurance maintained by the Indian Post Office; (x) deductions made with the written \\nauthorisation of the employee for payment of any premium on his life insurance policy or \\npurchase of securities.\\n Example: One of the most famous payments of wages acts is the Payment of Wages Act \\nof 1936 in India. The law was passed by the Bombay High Court while India was still under \\nBritish colonial control. The Act notes that unfair treatment of workers is common and takes \\nmany forms. It specifically prohibits employers from making any unauthorized with holdings \\nfrom workers’ wages. The Payment of Wages Act of 1936 only applies to workers with incomes \\nbelow a certain threshold. It also only applies to industrial and railroad workers, who were \\namong the most imperiled groups in India in the 1930s.\\n6.2.1 Responsibility of this Act\\nSection 3 makes every employer responsible for the payment to persons employed by him of all \\nwages required to be paid under the Act. Quite apart from this the following persons shall also be \\nresponsible for the payment of wages for persons employed otherwise by a contractor:\\nzl In a factory, a person named as manager of a factory under the Factories Act, 1948.\\nzl In industrial or other establishment a person responsible to the employer for the supervision \\nand control of the industrial or other establishment.\\nzl Upon railways (otherwise than in factories), if the employer is the railway administration \\nand the person nominated in this behalf.'),\n",

The amount of such deduction shall in no case bear to the wages \\npayable to the employed person in respect of the wage period for which the deduction is made a \\nlarger proportion than the period for which he was absent bears to the total period, within such \\nwage period, during which by the terms of his employment, he was required to work:\\nProvided that, subject to any rules made in this behalf by the Provincial Government, if ten or \\nmore employed persons acting in concert absent themselves without due notice (that is to say \\nwithout giving the notice which is required under the terms of their contracts of employment) \\nand without reasonable cause, such deduction from any such person may include such amount \\nnot exceeding his wages for eight days as may by any such terms be due to the employer in lieu \\nof due notice.\\nNotes  Deductions for absence from duty. Deductions from wages on account of \\nabsence of an employed person should be proportionate to the period of absence from \\nwork. If a man is absent for one day out of 8, he can only lose 1/8 of his wages and the \\nemployer cannot make a greater deduction because of the inconvenience occasioned to \\nhim by such absence (Arvind Mills Ltd. vs. K. R. Gadgil, A.I.R. 1941, Bom. 26). Also as \\nper sub-section (2) of this section, if the duration of his wage period is one month, the \\ntotal number of working days being 25, and the employed person is absent from duty for \\nfour days, the maximum deduction allowed is 4/25th of the wages for the month. This \\nis so because the amount of deduction is to be proportionate to the period for which a \\nperson is required to work which is 25 days in the present case. This section lays down the \\nmaximum amount of deduction. It may be less if the employer so wills.\\n!\\nCaution  As an exception to what is said in the above paragraph, the employer is entitled to \\nmake deduction upto 8 days of wages where ten or more employed persons acting under \\nconcert absent themselves without due notice and without reasonable cause. It may be \\nnoted that the legislature has not used the word ‘strike’ though this proviso relates to strike \\nso called. The reason seems to be that the word ‘strike’ is used in different senses and has \\nno accepted connotation.\\n6.6.6 Deductions for Damage of Loss (Sec. 10)\\nA deduction for damage to or loss or goods expressly entrusted to the employed person for \\ncustody, or for loss of money which he is required to account can be made where such loss is \\ndirectly attributable to his neglect or default. A deduction for damage or loss shall not exceed \\nthe amount of damage or loss caused to the employer by his neglect or default. A deduction for \\ndamage or loss shall not be made until the employed person has been given an opportunity of \\nshowing cause against the deduction. All deductions and realisations in respect of damage or loss \\nshall be recorded in a register to be kept by the person responsible for the payment of wages.'),\n",

Mahadeo Raghoo and Anothers, \\nrespondent was a gangman in the employ of the Central Railway Act that time his wages \\nwere ` 18 per month plus dearness allowance. With effect from the 1st November 1947 \\nthe Railway Board under Ministry of Railways of the Government of Indian introduced \\na scheme of grant of compensatory (city) allowance and house rent allowance at rates \\nspecified in their memorandum. This scheme was modified by the Railway Board’s letter. \\nAs a result of this scheme certain railway employees stationed at specified headquarters \\nwere eligible for the allowance aforesaid at certain specified rates. The 1st respondent \\nthus became entitled to the allowance of ` 10 per month. Therefore he was offered a rent \\nallowance by the government which he refused. The question came up for consideration \\nthat whether deduction could be made regarding the house allowance. \\nThe Court held that, Section 7 of the Act deals with such deductions as may be made from \\nthe wages as defined in the Act, of an employee. Sub-section (2) of section 7 categorically \\nspecifies the heads under which deductions may lawfully be made from wages. Clause \\n(d) of this sub-section has reference to “deductions for house accommodation supplied by \\nthe employer”, and section 11 provides that such a deduction shall not be made unless the \\nhouse accommodation has been accepted by the employee and shall not exceed the amount \\nequivalent to the value of such accommodation. The definition of “wages” in the Act also \\nexcludes from its operation the value of house accommodation referred to in sections 7 and \\n11 as aforesaid. The legislature has used the expression “value of any house accommodation” \\nin the definition of “wages” as denoting something which can be deducted from “wages”. \\nThe one excludes the other. It is thus clear that the definition of “wages” under the Act \\ncannot include the value of any house accommodation supplied by the employer to the \\nemployee; otherwise it would not be a legally permissible deduction from wages. It is \\nequally clear that house rent allowance which may in certain circumstances as aforesaid \\nbe included in “wages” is not the same thing as the value of any house accommodation \\nreferred to in the Act. That being so, there is no validity in the argument advanced on \\nbehalf of the 1st respondent that rule 3(i) aforesaid is inconsistent with the provisions of \\nsections 7 and 11 of the Act. Therefore the appeal allowed.\\nQuestion\\nCritically analyse the above case.\\nSource: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1593043\\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n12.

A beginning of social security in India was made with the \\npassing of the Workmen’s Compensation Act in 1923. Prior to 1923, it was almost impossible for \\nan injured workman to recover damages or compensation for any injury sustained by him in the \\n‘ordinary course of his employment. Of course, there were rare occasions when the employer \\nwas liable under the common law for his own personal negligence. The dependants of a deceased \\nworkman could, in rare cases, claim damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855; if the accident \\nwas due to a wrongful act, neglect or fault of the person who caused the death. In 1921, the \\ngovernment formulated some proposals for the grant of compensation and circulated them for \\nopinion. The proposals received general support. As a result, the Workmen’s Compensation Act \\nwas passed in March 1923 and was put into force on July 1, 1924. Subsequently, there were a \\nnumber of amendments to the Act. The Act contains 36 sections and four Schedules. The purpose \\nof this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you \\nshould be able to understand various concepts regarding the Workmen’s Compensation Act.\\n7.1 Genes of the Act\\nThe Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 provides for payment of compensation to workmen and \\ntheir dependants in case of injury and accident (including certain occupational disease) arising \\nout of and in the course of employment and resulting in disablement or death. The Act applies \\nto railway servants and persons employed in any such capacity as is specified in Schedule II of \\nthe Act. The schedule II includes persons employed in factories, mines, plantations, mechanically \\npropelled vehicles, construction works and certain other hazardous occupations. The amount of \\ncompensation to be paid depends on the nature of the injury and the average monthly wages and \\nage of workmen. The minimum and maximum rates of compensation payable for death (in such \\ncases it is paid to the dependents of workmen) and for disability have been fixed and is subject \\nto revision from time to time. A Social Security Division has been set up under the Ministry of \\nLabour and Employment, which deals with framing of social security policy for the workers and \\nimplementation of the various social security schemes. It is also responsible for enforcing this \\nAct.\\nNotes  The Act is administered by the State Governments through Commissioners for \\nWorkmen’s Compensation.\\n7.1.1 Object of the Act\\nThe object of the Act is to impose an obligation upon employers to pay compensation to workers \\nfor accidents arising out of and in the course of employment. The scheme of the Act is not to \\ncompensate the workman in lieu of wages, but to pay compensation for the injury sustained to \\nhim. The Workmen’s Compensation Act, aims to:\\nzl Provide workmen and/or their dependents some relief or to consider compensation \\npayable by an employer to his workmen in case of accidents arising out of and in the course \\nof employment and causing either death or disablement of workmen as a measure of relief \\nand social security.\\nzl Provide for payment by certain classes of employers to their workmen compensation for \\ninjury by accident.\\nzl To enable a workmen to get compensation irrespective of his negligence.\\nzl It lays down the various amounts payable in case of an accident, depending upon the type \\nand extent of injury. The employer now knows the amount of compensation he has to \\npay and is saved of many uncertainties to which he was subject before the Act came into \\nforce.'),\n",

I.e. the ensuing \\nlitigation, and the time and money that s/he will have to incur, which often influences \\nthe worker to accept the lesser amount.

An \\nunscrupulous employer may pay a lesser amount to the deceased’s dependents. Similarly \\nan unscrupulous dependent may collude with the employer to deny other dependents of \\ntheir share.

A workman is also not entitled to compensation if he does \\nnot present himself for medical examination when required, or if he fails to take proper medical \\ntreatment which aggravates the injury or disease. In case it is not fatal, an employment injury \\nmay’ cause any injury resulting in permanent total disablement, permanent partial disablement, \\nor temporary disablement (Section 3). \\nThe rate of compensation in case of death is an amount equal to 50 per cent of the monthly wages \\nof the deceased workman multiplied by the relevant factor or an amount of ` 50,000, whichever \\nis higher.

S. Gurushanthappa  \\n and Anr.\\nA certain Basavaraj was the driver of a privately owned car. In the night of October 28, 1992 \\nhe took out the car for a joyride and along with five persons, who were his neighbours, \\nproceeded for the nearby Anjaneya temple for offering pooja. On way to the temple the \\ncar met with a fatal accident in which Basavaraj and four other occupants of the car died; \\nthe fifth passenger sustained injuries but escaped death. One of the persons dying in that \\nmotor accident was Nagaraj, whose parents are the appellants before this Court.\\nThe heirs and legal representatives of the deceased driver, Basavaraj filed a claim for \\ncompensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. They got nothing. The \\nCommissioner under the Workmen’s Compensation Act found and held that the accident \\ndid not take place in course of employment and rejected the claim for compensation.\\nThe heirs of the four occupants of the car, dying in the accident (including the present \\nappellants) and the fifth passenger suffering injuries in the accident sought compensation \\nbefore the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal. Their claims proved to be equally barren. \\nThe appellants took the matter in appeal before the High Court where they were equally \\nunsuccessful. They are now in appeal before this Court by special leave.\\nThe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants raised a very limited issue. He submitted \\nthat in any event the appellants were entitled to the ‘no fault compensation’ as provided \\nunder section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 but they were denied even that by the \\nTribunal for reasons that are totally unsustainable in law.\\nWe are, therefore, required to see how and why the appellants were denied compensation \\nunder section 140 of the Act and how far the denial was justified. The appellants filed a \\nclaim petition (MVC 1404/92) before the District Judge and MACT, Chitrandurga under \\nsection 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act seeking compensation for the death of Nagaraj. The \\nappellants’ petition, along with four other claim petitions (filed by the heirs of the other \\nthree occupants dying in that car accident and the fifth occupant who suffered injuries in \\nthat accident), was disposed of by the Tribunal by a common order dated May 9, 1996. \\nFrom the order of the Tribunal, it appears that in four of the five cases before it, including \\nMVC 1404/92, IAs were filed seeking interim compensation of rupees twenty five thousand \\n(` 25,000.00) only (as the law stood at that time) in terms of section 140 of the Act. For some \\nreason, however, no order was passed on the IAs and the Tribunal proceeded to examine \\nthe claimants’ claim on merits under section 166 of the Act.\\nThe Tribunal, in its order summarized the cases of each of the five claimants separately, \\nnoting the facts peculiar to the four deceased and the fifth injured occupant of the ill fated \\ncar. It also framed the issues arising in each case separately. In regard to Nagaraj, the son of \\nthe appellants, it noted that at the time of his death he was eighteen years old. According to \\nthe appellants, he worked at a sweetmeat stall and earned rupees eight hundred (` 800.00) \\nonly per month. He was going to Anjaneya temple in the car being driven by Basavaraj and \\nin the accident he died on the spot. The appellants claimed compensation of rupees one \\nlakh (` 1,00,000.00) only. \\nThe first two issues in the case of Nagaraj, as in all the other cases, were answered by the \\nTribunal in the affirmative.

On the basis of the post mortem report, the Tribunal held \\nthat Nagaraj, at the time of his death, was aged about fifteen years. It further held that there \\nwas no evidence to show that at the time of his death Nagaraj earned anything, pointing out \\nthat in paragraph 22 of the claim petition nothing material was mentioned about the loss of \\nearning due to his death. Then, rather gratuitously it fixed the amount of compensation at \\nrupees thirty thousand plus two thousand (` 30,000.00 + ` 2,000.00) observing as follows:\\n“Hence the maximum compensation that can be granted to the petitioner herein would \\nbe only about ` 30,000-00 as being just and reasonable and a sum of ` 2,000-00 toward \\nfuneral and obsequious expenses etc. and therefore the petitioners are granted sum total \\ncompensation amount of ` 32,000-00.”\\nHaving, thus, put the worth of the life of Nagaraj at rupees thirty thousand ( ` 30,000.00) \\nonly the Tribunal proceeded to consider whether the appellants were entitled to receive \\neven this amount from the owner of the car or the insurance company (second part of issue \\nno. 3 and issue no. 4). It held that neither the owner of the car nor the insurance company \\nwas liable to pay anything to any of the claimants, including the appellants, because \\nBasavaraj had taken out the car of his employer unauthorisedly and against his express \\ninstructions and had caused the accident by driving the car very rashly after consuming \\nliquor. At the time of accident the car had been taken completely away from the control of \\nits owner. In a sense it was stolen by the driver, even though temporarily. The accident was, \\nthus, completely outside the insurance policy. No compensation was, therefore, payable to \\nany of the claimants under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act.\\nUp to this stage no exception can be taken to the view taken by the Tribunal. But surprisingly \\nthe Tribunal also rejected the express prayer made on behalf of the appellants and other \\nclaimants to at least grant the ‘no fault compensation’ as provided under section 140 of the \\nAct. The Tribunal discussed the issue over six pages in its judgment before turning down \\nthe claim. It seems to have taken the view, that had the claim for ‘no fault compensation’ \\nbeen made at the beginning of the proceeding, it might have considered it favourably. But \\nthe claim was pressed at a belated stage when it was considering the claim for compensation \\nunder section 166 of the Act and more importantly had found that the owner of the car had \\nno responsibility for the accident. In this connection, the Tribunal observed as follows:\\n“However, in these cases as already referred to above, if at the initial stage itself if the \\nlearned counsel Sri. M. Gnana Swamy had pressed the Tribunal to pass interim award on \\nI.A.I in all the four cases, then the I.A.I filed in all four cases would have been definitely \\nallowed and this Tribunal would have directed both the respondents 1 & 2 and more \\nparticularly respondent No.2 to deposit the interim compensation amount leaving open \\nthe liability aspect at the fag end of these cases i.e., at the arguments stage. Now that stage \\nis already over and as such now this Tribunal has to consider equally as to whether at this \\nstage as per the principle of no fault liability under s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, \\nthese petitioners are entitled for the interim in compensation amount.”\\n“Now as regards the no fault liability as already referred to above, perhaps the petitioners \\nwould have been granted the interim compensation amount at the initial stage, but now it \\ncannot be done, since the merits of the cases are being dealt with after hearing the arguments \\nat the final stage and the main cases are being disposed of on merits as such.”\\n“Hence in view of my finding that the car was being used totally outside the course of \\nthe employment of the driver of the car and totally without the knowledge and consent \\nof the 1st respondent, I hold that even as regards this no fault liability claim also, the 1st \\nrespondent or for the matter 2nd respondent amount to any of the petitioner’s hearing. \\nHence this being the position, I am constrained to observe and hold that although as per \\nthe available evidence on record the petitioners are entitled for compensation amount as \\nContd...'),\n",

The Tribunal was gravely in error in taking the view that a \\nclaim for compensation under section 140 of the Act can succeed only in case it is raised at \\nthe initial stage of the proceedings and further that the claim must fail if the accident had \\ntaken place by using the car without the consent or knowledge of its owner. Section 140 is \\nthe first section of chapter X of the Act. It is a small chapter consisting of only five sections \\n(from 140 to 144) and has the marginal heading “Liability without Fault in Certain Cases”. \\nSection 140 reads as under:\\nIn light of the discussions made above, we are unhesitatingly of the view, that the Tribunal \\nwas completely wrong in denying to the appellant, the compensation in terms of section \\n140 of the Act. We find and hold that the appellant (as well as the other 3 claimants) were \\nfully entitled to no fault compensation under section 140 of the Act.

The \\nWorkmen’s Compensation Act (Act VIII of 1923) came into force from 1st July, 1924. It applies to \\nthe whole of India, including the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Act provides for the payment \\nof compensation by certain classes of employers to their workmen, for injury by accidents. The \\nWorkmen’s Compensation Act does not apply to factories covered by the Employees State \\nInsurance Act. The Amendment of 1976. The Workmen’s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1976, \\nwas passed with the object of providing suitable scales of compensation for the higher wage \\nlevels beyond ` 500. The reason is that all wages have been increased. Before the amendment, the \\nAct covered workmen whose wages did not exceed ` 500 per month. The purpose of this Unit \\nis to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you should be \\nable to understand the rules relating to the Workmen’s Compensation Act.\\n8.1 Workmen’s Compensation\\nFollowing aspects are included in the Workmen’s Compensation:\\n8.1.1 Employer’s Liability for Compensation [Section 3]\\nAn employer is liable to pay compensation to a workman: \\nzl For personal injury caused to him by accident, and \\nzl For any occupational disease contracted by him.\\nPersonal Injury\\nPersonal injury includes: \\n(i) Must have been caused during the course of his employment; and \\n(ii) Must have been caused by accident arising out of his employment. \\nAn accident alone does not give a workman a right to compensation. To entitle him to compensation \\nat the hands of the employers the accident must arise out of and in the course of his employment. \\nThe language in Section 3 shows that injury is caused by accident and not ‘by an accident’.

The Commissioner and the Tribunal had held that the petitioner was \\ncovered by the provisions of the said Act and was liable to pay provident fund contribution \\nin respect of such 20 workmen. It was found that out of 21 who were said to be employed \\nin the factory of the petitioner, 8 persons were temporarily labourers employed for the \\npurpose of carrying on the repairs of the factory building and the Court observed that it \\ncannot be held that they were employed for the normal business of the establishment. The \\nCourt further observed that it naturally depends upon the facts of each case as to whether \\nthe so called temporary workmen are regularly employed in connection with the normal \\nand usual course of the business or they are engaged in the performance of some work \\nwhich had no relation with the normal and regular course of business of the establishment. \\nEven if casual or temporary workers are engaged occasionally or intermittently to meet \\nsome temporary or casual work, such workmen cannot be considered to be employees for \\nthe purpose of section 1 (3)(a) of the Act. The high Court held that unless temporary or \\ncasual workers are found to be regular employees of an industrial unit, the same cannot \\nbe included to make 20 workmen of an industrial unit for the purpose of determining \\nwhether the establishment is covered under the definition in section 1 (3)(a) of the Act.

Even in case of proved negligence, the employer could get rid of his liability by \\nusing any of the following defences:\\n1. The Doctrine of Assumed Risks:  If the employee knew the nature of the risks he was \\nundertaking when working in a factory, the employer had no liability for injuries. The \\ncourt assumed in such case that the workman had voluntarily accepted the risks inci dental \\nto his work. The doctrine followed from the rule Volenti Non Fit Injuria, which means \\nthat one, who has volunteered to take a risk of injury, is not entitled to damages if injury \\nactually occurs.\\n2. The Doctrine of Common Employment:  Under this rule, when several Persons work \\ntogether for a common purpose and one of them is injured by some act or omission of \\nanother, the employer is not liable to pay compensation for the injury.\\n3. The Doctrine of Contributory Negligence:  Under this rule a person is not entitled to \\ndamages for injury if he was himself guilty of negligence and such negligence contributed \\nto the injury.\\nDid u know?  The three aforesaid defences and the rule “no negligence no liabi lity made.” \\nIt almost impossible for an employee to obtain relief in cases of accident. The Workmen’s \\nCompensation Act of 1923 radi cally changed the law.\\nAccording to this Act, the employer is liable to pay compensation irrespective of negligence. \\nThe Act looks upon compensation as relief to the workman and not as damages payable by the \\nemployer for a wrongful act or tort. Hence contributory negligence by the employee does not \\ndisentitle him from relief. For the same reason, it is not possible for the employer to plead to the \\ndefence of common employment or assumed risks for the purpose of avoiding liability. Thus the \\nAct makes it possible for the workman to get compensation for injuries, unimpeded by the legal \\nobstacles set up by the law of Torts.\\nTwo ways of claiming compensation\\nAn injured workman may, if he wishes, file a civil suit for damages against the employer. \\nSection 3(5) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, however, provides that if such a suit is filed, \\ncompensation cannot be claimed under the Act and if compensation has been claimed under the \\nAct, or if an agreement has been entered into between the employer and the workman for the \\npayment of .compensation, no suit can be filed in the civil court. Thus the workman has to choose \\nbetween two reliefs –\\n(i) civil suit for damages and\\n(ii) claim for compensation under the Act. He cannot have both.'),\n",

The judgment calls for the amendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, \\nwhich fixes a ceiling of ` 4,000 a month as the maximum wage of a labourer while calculating \\nthe “employment injury compensation” to an injured workman or while arriving at the \\ncompensation to dependants in case of death. Against the backdrop of criticism in trade \\nunion circles that the “judiciary has turned its back on the working people and the poor, \\nparticularly since the era of economic liberalisation”, Justice N. Kirubakaran, in his February \\n8 judgment, observes thus: “Minimum monthly wages can be fixed and there cannot be \\nany ceiling on the monthly wages. Fixing maximum monthly wages is detrimental to the \\ninterests of the working class and would certainly affect the fundamental rights of the \\nworkers guaranteed under Articles 19 (1) (g) [Right to carry on occupation] and 21 [Right to \\nlife].” He said fixing ` 4,000 as the maximum wage, under Section 4 (1) Explanation-II of the \\nAct, went against the very object of the Act and it was high time the Act was amended.\\nThe judgment comes in the wake of an appeal by the Oriental Insurance Company against \\nthe award of ` 4,34,650 to a mason who suffered 80 per cent disability in an accident during \\nthe course of employment on August 20, 2003, and claimed ` 3,00,000 as compensation. \\nGoing into two “substantial questions of law at the time of admission” of the appeal, the \\ncourt upheld the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Labour that the claimant was \\na “workman” who suffered injuries during the course of employment and confirmed his \\naward fixing the compensation at ` 4,34,650. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and \\nthe All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) have welcomed the judgment. Recalling that \\nthe Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, has its origins in the colonial period like many \\nother primary and major Acts, the court pointed out that but for “cosmetic amendments”, \\nthe main statement of object and reasons for the enactment of the law remained the same. \\nThe object of the piece of legislation was to compensate for injuries arising out of accidents \\nduring the course of employment and resulting in disablement or death, the judge pointed \\nout. He said that as the object was very laudable and the legislation had been enacted \\nfor the benefit of workmen, there should not have been a ceiling on the monthly wage of \\nworkers at ` 4,000.\\nContd...'),\n",

Therefore, the maximum \\nmonthly wage of ` 4,000 fixed in the Act is very meagre and requires reconsideration by \\nway of enhancement or deletion of ceiling fixed under Section 4 (1) Explanation II of the \\nAct,” the judge observed. He also wondered why labour forums and associations had \\nmissed the implications of the section and had not challenged the provision.\\nWhile passing the order, Justice Kirubakaran referred to the January 5 judgment of a two-\\njudge Bench of the Supreme Court of India comprising Justice G.S. Singhvi and Justice \\nAsok Kumar Ganguly in Harjinder Singh vs. Punjab State Warehousing Corporation. The \\njudges, in separate but concurring judgments, stressed the need to protect the rights of \\nworkers in the liberalised and globalised scenario.\\nThe Madras High Court judgment quotes Justice Singhvi’s observation as follows:\\n“Of late, there has been a visible shift in the courts’ approach in dealing with the cases \\ninvolving the interpretation of social welfare legislation. The attractive mantras of \\nglobalisation and liberalisation are fast becoming the raison d’etre of the judicial process \\nand an impression has been created that the constitutional courts are no longer sympathetic \\ntowards the plight of industrial and unorganised workers. In large number of cases like the \\npresent one, relief has been denied to the employees falling in the category of workmen, who \\nare illegally retrenched from service by creating bylanes and sidelanes in the jurisprudence \\ndeveloped by this court in three decades.”\\n“The stock plea raised by the public employer in such cases is that the initial employment/\\nengagement of the workman-employee was contrary to some or the other statute or that \\nreinstatement of the workman will put unbearable burden on the financial health of the \\nestablishment. The courts have readily accepted such plea unmindful of the accountability \\nof the wrongdoer and indirectly punished the tiny beneficiary of the wrong, ignoring the \\nfact that he may have continued in the employment for years together and that micro \\nwages earned by him may be the only source of his livelihood. It needs no emphasis that if \\na man is deprived of his livelihood, he is deprived of all his fundamental and constitutional \\nrights….”\\n“Therefore, the approach of the courts must be compatible with the constitutional \\nphilosophy of which the Directive Principles of State Policy constitute an integral part, \\nand justice due to the workman should not be denied by entertaining the specious and \\nuntenable grounds put forward by the employer – public or private.”\\nJustice Kirubakaran also referred to the observation of Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly, that \\nthe court “has a duty to interpret statutes with social welfare benefits in such a way as to \\nfurther the statutory goal and not to frustrate it. In doing so, this court should make an \\neffort to protect the rights of the weaker sections of society in view of the clear constitutional \\nmandate discussed above.” He further said that while awarding compensation under the \\nMotor Vehicles Act, 1988, factors such as disability, loss of income, pain and suffering, loss \\nof love and affection, loss of consortium, loss of damage to clothes and property and loss of \\nestate are considered whereas under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, disability alone is \\nconsidered for the purpose of calculating the loss of income.\\nStressing the need to revamp the Workmen’s Compensation Act on a par with the Motor \\nVehicles Act, he said “… an ‘injury’ sustained is always an ‘injury’ and the ‘pain’ suffered \\nis ‘pain’ with all elements and there cannot be any difference whether the victim gets relief \\nunder either of the Acts”. Praising the judgment, A.K. Padmanabhan, president of the Tamil \\nNadu unit of the CITU, said very rarely had a judgment of this type been awarded by the \\nSupreme Court or the High Courts. He described the High Court order and the judgment \\nof the two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court as “exceptional” and said he hoped they \\nwould not continue to be exceptions for too long.

On the High Court order calling for the \\nremoval of the ceiling on wages for calculating compensation, he said: “This is one area \\nwhere the government has been consistently taking a negative attitude towards the demands \\nof workers and trade unions.” He alleged that the government had made changes in the \\nvarious enactments on wages wherever it wanted to favour the employers, but nothing of \\nmuch use to the workers had been done in this regard. With regard to pieces of legislations \\nsuch as the Workmen’s Compensation Act and the Bonus Act, the wage ceiling had not \\nbeen amended for years, he said. Though it had been continuously pointed out by trade \\nunions in various tripartite meetings including the Indian Labour Conference, the highest \\ntripartite body in the country, that certain sections of the Bonus Act had become obsolete, \\nthe wage limits prescribed for the application of the bonus law remained, he added.\\nPointing out that only recently the Union Cabinet decided to amend the Gratuity Act, \\nwhich put a ceiling on the maximum amount payable to workers, he said, these were \\nonly a few examples to show how wage ceilings in the present inflationary situations took \\naway the meagre amounts that workers were to get as a benefit or as compensation. At \\nleast in the wake of the High Court’s judgment, he said, the government should come \\nforward to amend the Workmen’s Compensation Act on the lines of the Motor Vehicles \\nAct. Expressing similar sentiments, S.S. Thyagarajan, general secretary of the State unit of \\nthe AITUC, said trade unions had always demanded that the government lift the ceiling on \\nthe wages for all welfare schemes, including Provident Fund, Employees’ State Insurance, \\nand bonus. According to him, the judgment of the High Court “has a tinge of humanitarian \\nconsideration”. He pointed out that the governments had always been reluctant to effect \\nan upward revision of wages that would benefit workers. Whenever amendments effected \\nan enhancement of wages, the increases became virtually redundant owing to belated \\nimplementation, he said. “We hope the essence of the judgment will be taken into account \\nand wages will be enhanced appropriately to benefit workers and their families,” he said.\\nQuestion:\\nCritically analyse the above case.\\nSource: //www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2707/stories/20100409270709800.htm\\n8.7 Summary\\nzl The language in Section 3 shows that injury is caused by accident and not ‘by an \\naccident’.\\nzl The wilful disregard of the usage of the safety device or safety guard provided for the \\npurpose of securing safety of the workman by the employer.\\nzl Schedule III is divided into three parts, viz., A, B and C.

This forms 8 to 10% of the \\ntotal earnings of workers. As its payment can now be claimed as a legal right, it is looked upon \\nby the working class as a great hope and expectation. Again, as real wages payable to most of the \\nworkers in India have not reached even the prewar (1939) level, the annual bonus will continue to \\nplay the part of tilling the gap between the existing and the living wage. Though views have been \\nexpressed for the total abolition of bonus claim, and instead for raising the wage level, it appears \\nthat such a radical step has no chance of acceptance at least till the whole wage policy undergoes \\na rational and planned formulation in place of its present haphazard growth. The purpose of this \\nUnit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you should \\nbe able to understand various concepts regarding the Payment of Bonus Act.\\n9.1 An Overview of Payment of Bonus Act\\nThe Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 was enacted to provide for the payment of bonus to persons \\nemployed in certain establishments on the basis of profits or productivity and for the matters \\nconnected therewith. The Act applies to:- (i) every factory as defined under the Factories Act, 1948; \\nand (ii) every other establishment in which twenty or more persons are employed on any day \\nduring an accounting year. However, the Government may, after giving two months’ notification \\nin the Official Gazette, make the Act applicable to any factory or establishment employing less \\nthan twenty but not less than ten persons.\\nThe Act is enforced through the Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM). CIRM is an \\nattached office of the Ministry of Labour and is also known as the Chief Labour Commissioner \\n(Central) [CLC(C)] Organisation. It is headed by the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central).\\n9.1.1 Concept of Bonus\\nConcept of annual profit bonus has a long history behind it. Originally bonus was regarded as a \\ngift or an ex-gratia payment by any employer to his employees in cash or kind to motivate their \\nefforts on important festivals like Diwali, Durga Puja and Onam. Before the First World War \\nsome European firms used to given free Dhoties and other household articles on festivals, while \\nIndian firms gave gifts in cash and kind by way of bonus. In Bengal there was a system of paying \\nbonus at the time of Durga Puja irrespective of profit and loss. In large concerns extra payments \\nwere made which were called bonus. A proper system of paying bonus was started during the \\nFirst World War. In 1917 the textile industry in Bombay and Ahmedabad gave 10 recent increase \\nin wages calling it a war bonus, and this was increased to 15 per cent in 1918. After the war when \\nsome concerns stopped paying bonus. Workers claimed it (fit as a right, and went on strike. The \\nmatter was referred to a committee headed by the Chief Justice of Bombay in February, 1924. The \\nCommittee observed that the employees had not established any enforceable claim, customary, \\nlegal or equitable. However, workers continued to receive bonus as an ex-gratia payment in \\nconcerns which were making profit. During the years that followed bonus ceased to be a serious \\nindustrial relations problem due to economic recession.\\nDuring the 2nd World War, bonus again became a live issue when industries started making \\nextra-ordinary profits. Though some employers paid bonus voluntarily, many disputes regarding \\nbonus were referred to ad-hoc Industrial Courts of Tribunals for adjudication under the Defence \\nof India Rules. Some of these disputes went upto the Supreme Court also. The adjudicators took \\nthe view that profits were made possible by the joint efforts of both capital and labour. The latter \\ntherefore had a right to share in the increased profits. This position continued until the Bombay \\nHigh Court laid down that the payment of Bonus could be demanded by workers as a right, \\nthat is to say, a payment which could be made by the employer as extra remuneration for work'),\n",

Here it is not required \\nthat the employer has any allocable surplus in the accounting year.

Prior to 1965, the employers made ex-gratia \\npayment to the workers by way of bonus which they stopped from that year. A \\nBoard of Arbitrators appointed under s. 10A of the Industrial Disputes Act, to which the \\nbonus dispute was referred, rejected the workers demand for bonus. The dispute was \\neventually referred to an Industrial Tribunal which in limine dismissed the workers’ \\ndemand as being barred by res judicata, in view of the decision of the Arbitration Board. \\nThe Tribunal in addition. held that bonus so far paid having been founded on tradition and \\ncustom, did not fall within the four-corners of the Bonus Act which is a complete code and \\ncame to the conclusion that the workers were not entitled bonus. On appeal to this Court \\nit was contended that (i) the appellant-Union not being a party to the dispute had no locus \\nstandi, (ii) the claim of the workmen not being profit-based bonus, which is what the Bonus \\nAct deals with, the Act has no application to this case; and (iii) since no case of customary \\nor contract bonus was urged before the Arbitration Board such a ground was barred by the \\ngeneral principles of res judicata.\\nDismissing the appeal\\nIn an industrial dispute the process of conflict resolution is informal, rough and ready and \\ninvites a liberal approach. Technically the union cannot be the appellant, the workmen \\nbeing the real parties. There is a terminological lapse in the cause title, but a reading of \\nthe petition, the description of the parties, the grounds urged and grievances aired, show \\nthat the battle was between the workers and the employers and the Union represented \\nthe workers. The substance of the matter being obvious, formal defects fades away. \\nProcedural prescriptions are handmaids, not mistresses of justice and failure of fair play is \\nthe spirit in which Courts must view processual deviances. Public interest is promoted by \\na spacious construction of locus standi in our socio-economic circumstances, conceptual \\nlatitudinarianism permits taking liberties with individualisation of the right to invoke the \\nhigher courts where the remedy is shared by a considerable number, particularly when they \\nare weaker. In industrial law collective bargaining, union representation at conciliations, \\narbitrations, adjudications and appellate and other proceedings is a welcome development \\nand an enlightened advance in industrial life. [597G] In the instant case the union is an \\nabbreviation for the totality of workmen involved in the dispute. The appeal is, therefore, \\nan appeal by the workmen compendiously projected and impleaded through the union. \\n[598D] [592]\\nThe demands referred by the State Govt. under s. 10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, \\nspecifically speak of payment of bonus by the employers which had become custom or \\nusage or a condition of service in the establishments. The subject matter of the dispute \\nreferred by the Govt. dealt with bonus based on custom or condition of service. The \\nTribunal was bound to investigate this question. The workers in their statements urged \\nthat the demand was not based on profits or financial results of the employer but was \\nbased on custom.

Beside the Bombay Industrial \\nRelations Act, 1946, and the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair \\nLabour Practices Act, 1971, Trade Unions Act, 1926 is the only legal framework for the trade \\nunions by conceding to workmen their right of association and organising unions. It permits \\nany seven persons to form their union and get it registered under the Act Registration of unions \\nis optional and not compulsory. The National Commission on Labour (1969) recommended \\ncompulsory recognition of trade unions, but this recommendation is still under the consideration \\nof the Government. However, the (1982) amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, makes \\nregistration compulsory virtually by defining the term “Trade Union”, for the purposes of this \\nAct, as a Union registered under the Trade Unions Act, 1926. This gives Unions certain rights \\nand immunities which unregistered Trade Unions do not enjoy. Therefore, workers tend to be \\nmembers of registered trade unions. Besides specifying the procedure for registration of union, \\nthis Act lays down the guidelines for the day to day working of the registered unions. The purpose \\nof this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you \\nshould be able to understand various concepts regarding The Trade Union Act.\\n10.1 Genesis of the Act\\nTrade union is a voluntary organization of workers pertaining to a particular trade, industry or \\na company and formed to promote and protect their interests and welfare by collective action. \\nThey are the most suitable organisations for balancing and improving the relations between the \\nemployer and the employees. They are formed not only to cater to the workers’ demand, but also \\nfor inculcating in them the sense of discipline and responsibility. \\nIn India, the first organised trade union was formed in 1918 and since then they have spread \\nin almost all the industrial centres of the country. The legislation regulating these trade unions \\nis the Indian Trade Unions Act, 1926. The Act deals with the registration of trade unions, their \\nrights, their liabilities and responsibilities as well as ensures that their funds are utilised properly. \\nIt gives legal and corporate status to the registered trade unions. It also seeks to protect them \\nfrom civil or criminal prosecution so that they could carry on their legitimate activities for the \\nbenefit of the working class. The Act is applicable not only to the union of workers but also to the \\nassociation of employers. It extends to whole of India. Also, certain Acts, namely, the Societies \\nRegistration Act, 1860; the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912; and the Companies Act, 1956 shall \\nnot apply to any registered trade union, and that the registration of any such trade union under \\nany such Act shall be void.\\nThe Act is administered by the Ministry of Labour through its Industrial Relations Division. \\nThe Division is concerned with improving the institutional framework for dispute settlement \\nand amending labour laws relating to industrial relations. It works in close co-ordination with \\nthe Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) in an effort to ensure that the country gets a \\nstable, dignified and efficient workforce, free from exploitation and capable of generating higher \\nlevels of output. The CIRM, which is an attached office of the Ministry of Labour, is also known'),\n",

The basic provisions of the Act are:-\\n1. The Act provides for the registration of the trade unions with the ‘Registrars of Trade \\nUnions’ set up in different States, like the Office of Registrar (Trade Union) set up by the \\nGovernment of National Capital Territory of Delhi. For registration of a trade union, seven \\nor more members of the union can submit their application in the prescribed form to the \\nRegistrar of trade unions. \\nNotes  The application shall be accompanied by a copy of the ‘rules of the trade union’ \\nand a statement giving the following particulars:- (i) Names, occupations and addresses of \\nthe members making the application; (ii)The name of the trade union and the address of \\nits head office; (iii) The titles, names, ages, addresses and occupations of the office bearers \\nof the trade union as per the format given in the Trade Unions Act 1926. The Registrar, \\non being satisfied that the Union has complied with all the requirements of this Act, \\nshall register the trade union. Thereafter, it shall issue a certificate of registration in the \\nprescribed form as a conclusive evidence of registration of that Trade Union.'),\n",

The trade unions have thus \\nacquired an important place in the economic, political and social set up of the country.\\n10.1.4 Scope and Coverage\\nThe expression “Trade Union” under the Act includes both employers and workers organizations \\nEmployers organisations also can be registered as trade unions. The intention is to place both on \\npar in matters of rights and responsibilities. It is primarily the objective of an association or \\ncombination which determines whether it is a trade union or not.\\nThe federation of two or more trade unions mentioned in the definition can be seen in shape of \\nIndustrial Federations of Trade Unions.\\nBombay Industrial Relations Act, 1948 is .the most important state enactment. The relevant \\nfeatures of the Act are (a) compulsory recognition of union by employer, (b) giving the right \\nto workers to get their case represented either through representative union or where there is \\nno representative union in industry/centre/unit through elected representative of workers or \\nthrough Government labour officer. \\nThere is no provision in the Trade Unions Act, 1926 about sorting out inter or intra trade union \\ndisputes. In such eventuality, aggrieved party has to take recourse to common law of the land \\nand redressal through courts. \\nThis Act extends to the whole of India. Under the Act, the term “Trade Union” is defined as any \\ncombination whether temporary or permanent, formed primarily for the purpose of regulating \\nthe relations between workmen and employers, or between workmen and workmen, or between \\nemployer and employers, or for imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade \\nof business, and includes any federation of two or more trade unions. In other words, a trade \\nunion is a combination or association of not only of workmen but also of the employers. The Act, \\ntherefore, applies not only to the unions of workers but also to the associations of employers. \\n(Sec. 2H) \\n\\uf026\\nCaselet  IG Metall - A Trade Union in Crisis?\\nO\\nn April 24, 2006, an agreement was reached between IG Metall Trade Union (IG \\nMetall, also known as Industrie Gewerkschaft Metall or German Metalworker’s \\nUnion), one of the oldest and largest trade unions in Germany and Gesamtmetall \\nNational Employers’ Group (Gesamtmetall) on the wage increase for the union’s 3.4 \\nmillion members. Under the agreement, which was valid for 13 months, its members \\nwould receive a wage hike of three percent from June 2006 and a one time payment of 310 \\nEuros as bonus for the months of March, April, and May 2006. This agreement avoided a \\nseries of nationwide strikes that IG Metall had planned to hold in Germany.\\nAfter the agreement, Gesamtmetall members threatened to cut jobs or move them out of \\nGermany. They said that the agreement would increase labor costs and make exports less \\ncompetitive.\\nIt was estimated that an IG Metall worker in Germany made on an average about 25 Euros \\nan hour when compared to 6 Euros per hour earned by a worker in East European countries. \\nThe employers also warned that this wage increase could threaten the recovery of the \\nfragile German economy. They felt that the agreement would worsen the unemployment \\nsituation in Germany. Anton Boerner, head of one of the employer’s federation wrote, \\nContd...'),\n",

Three percent is simply \\ntoo much.” The agreement was of great significance to the German economy, the biggest \\neconomy in Europe, as it set the agenda for other trade unions in Germany in terms of \\ncollective bargaining.\\nIn Germany, most negotiations for collective bargaining and other agreements are \\nnegotiated between the trade unions and regional employer associations representing the \\nentire sector rather than with individual companies.\\nEarlier in January 2006, IG Metall had demanded a five percent increase in pay as it felt \\nthat these companies were making huge profits. It said that the increase in pay would \\nhelp the members cope with the rising cost of living, increase their purchasing power, and \\nto withstand the increase in valued added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent, which the \\nGerman government proposed to implement in 2007.\\nThe agreement would also influence inflation and price stability in the German economy, \\nand have repercussions on the wider European economy. Earlier, the European Central \\nBank (ECB) president, Jean-Claude Trichet, warned German companies against allowing \\nany pay increase. He said that if the pay demand was met, the ECB would be forced to raise \\ninterest rates to counter inflation.\\nControversy is not new to IG Metall. Over the decades, the union has played an important \\nrole in German labor relations and is considered by many as the pioneer in collective \\nbargaining in Germany. IG Metall has both blue and white collared workers as its members. \\nThough it is primarily a metalworkers’ union and represents the metal industry labor, \\nit has members from other industry sectors as well. Over the years, IG Metall has made \\nsignificant contributions to the evolution of industrial relations in Germany. But, it has also \\nbeen accused of irrational protection and harming the interests of workers and employees. \\nThe achievements and accusations present a contrasting and interesting picture of a trade \\nunion in a changing business environment.\\nSource: http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Human%20Resource%20and%20Organization%20Behavior/\\nIG%20Metall-Trade%20Union%20in%20Crisis-Human%20Resource%20Management.htm\\nSelf Assessment\\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\\n1.

A judgement of the Kolkata High Court restrained the company \\nfrom giving effect to the resolution it had passed in the extraordinary general meeting \\n(EGM) held in December 1998. The resolution was to seek the shareholders’ permission \\nto sell the color television (CTV) factory to Kitchen Appliances Limited, a subsidiary of \\nVideocon. The judgement came after a long drawn, bitter battle between the company and \\nits two unions Philips Employees Union (PEU) and the Pieco Workers’ Union (PWU) over \\nthe factory’s sale.\\nPEU president Kiron Mehta said, “The company’s top management should now see \\nreason. Ours is a good factory and the sale price agreed upon should be reasonable. Further \\nhow come some other company is willing to take over and hopes to run the company \\nprofitably when our own management has thrown its hands up after investing ` 70 crores \\non the plant.” Philips sources on the other hand refused to accept defeat. The company \\nimmediately revealed its plans to take further legal action and complete the sale at any \\ncost.\\nPIL’s operations dates back to 1930, when Philips Electricals Co. (India) Ltd., a subsidiary \\nof Holland based Philips NV was established. The company’s name was changed to Philips \\nIndia Pvt. Ltd. in September 1956 and it was converted into a public limited company \\nin October 1957. After being initially involved only in trading, PIL set up manufacturing \\nfacilities in several product lines. PIL commenced lamp manufacturing in 1938 in Kolkata \\nand followed it up by establishing a radio manufacturing factory in 1948. An electronics \\ncomponents unit was set up in Loni, near Pune, in 1959.\\nIn 1963, the Kalwa factory in Maharashtra began to produce electronics measuring \\nequipment. The company subsequently started manufacturing telecommunication \\nequipment in Kolkata.\\nIn the mid-1990s, Philips decided to follow Philips NV’s worldwide strategy of having a \\ncommon manufacturing and integrated technology to reduce costs. The company planned \\nto set up an integrated consumer electronics facility having common manufacturing \\ntechnology as well as suppliers base. Director Ramachandran stated that the company had \\nplans to depend on outsourcing rather than having its own manufacturing base in the \\nfuture. The company selected Pune as its manufacturing base and decided to get the Salt \\nLake factory off its hands.\\nIn tune with this decision, the employees were appraised and severance packages were \\ndeclared. Out of 750 workers in the Salt Lake division, 391 workers opted for VRS. PIL then \\nappointed Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) to scout for buyers for \\nthe factory. Videocon was one of the companies approached. \\nThough initially Videocon seemed to be interested, it expressed reservations about buying \\nan over staffed and under utilized plant. To make it an attractive buy, PIL reduced the \\nworkforce and modernised the unit, spending ` 7.1 crore in the process.\\nIn September 1998, Videocon agreed to buy the factory through its nominee, Kitchen \\nAppliances India Ltd. The total value of the plant was ascertained to be ` 28 crore and \\nVideocon agreed to pay ` 9 crore in addition to taking up the liability of ` 21 crore. Videocon \\nagreed to take over the plant along with the employees as a going concern along with \\nthe liabilities of VRS, provident fund etc. The factory was to continue as a manufacturing \\ncenter securing a fair value to its shareholders and employees.

The Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act is a social \\nsecurity legislation to provide for provident fund, family pension and insurance to employees. \\nEmployee has to pay contribution towards the fund. Employer also pays equal contribution. The \\nemployee gets a lump sum amount when he retires, which will be useful to him after retirement. \\nThe Act covers three schemes i.e. PF (Provident Fund scheme), FPF (Family Pension Fund scheme) \\nand EDLI (Employees Deposit Linked Insurance scheme). The EPF Act contains basic provisions \\nin respect of applicability, eligibility, damages, appeals, recovery etc. The three schemes formed \\nby Central Government under the Act make provisions in respect of those schemes. The purpose \\nof this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you \\nshould be able to understand various concepts regarding various schemes included in EPF Act. \\n11.1 Genesis of the Act\\nIn the previous unit, we dealt with the Trade Union Act. Legislation for compulsory institution \\nof contributory provident fund in industrial undertakings was discussed several times at \\ntripartite meetings in which representatives of the Central and State governments and of \\nemployers and workers took part. A large measure of agreement was reached on the need for \\nsuch legislation. A non-official Bill on this subject was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1948 to \\nprovide for the establishment and grant of provident fund to certain classes of workers by their \\nemployers. The Bill was withdrawn only on an assurance by the government that it would \\nsoon consider the introduction of a comprehensive bill. There was also a persistent demo that \\nthe Central Government extend the benefits of Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme to workers \\nemployed in other industries. The view that the proposed legislation should be undertaken was \\nlargely endorsed by the Conference of Provincial Labour Ministers’ held in January 1951. On \\n15th November 1951, the Government of India promulgated the Employees’ Provident Funds \\nOrdinance which came into force on that date. It was subsequently replaced by the Employees’ \\nProvident Funds Act passed on 4th March 1952.\\n11.1.1 Object of the Act\\nThe Act was passed with a view to making some provision for the future of the industrial worker \\nafter his retirement or for his dependants in case of his early death and inculcating the habit of \\nsaving among the workers. The object of the Act is to provide substantial security and timely \\nmonetary assistance to industrial employees and their families when they are in distress and/or'),\n",

Accordingly, the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme was framed under Section 5 of \\nthe Act, which came into force on 1st November 1952. \\n!\\nCaution  On a review of the working of the scheme over the years, it was found that \\nprovident fund was no doubt an effective old age and survivorship benefit; but in the event \\nof the premature death of an employee, the accumulations in the fund were not adequate \\nenough to render long-term financial protection to his family. \\nThis lacuna led to the introduction of the Employees’ Family Pension Scheme with effect from \\n1st March 1971. \\nDid u know?  The Act was further amended in 1976 with a view to introducing Employees’ \\nDeposit Linked Insurance Scheme, a measure to provide an insurance cover to the members \\nof the provident fund in covered establishments without the payment of any premium by \\nthese members. Thus; three schemes have been framed under the Employees’ Provident \\nFunds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act.\\n11.1.2 Applicability of the Act\\nThe Employees’ Provident Funds Act, 1952 is applicable from the date of functioning or date of \\nset-up of establishments provided the factory/establishment employed twenty or more persons. \\nThe Act, however, does not apply-to co-operative societies employing less than 50 persons \\nand working without the aid of power. The Central Government is empowered to apply the \\nprovisions of this Act to any establishments employing less than 20 persons after giving not less \\nthan two months’ notice of its intention to do so by a notification in the Official Gazette. Once \\nthe Act is applied, it does not cease to be applicable even if the number of employees falls below \\n20. An establishment/factory, which is not otherwise coverable under the Act, can be covered \\nvoluntarily with the mutual consent of the Act.\\n11.1.3 Administration\\nThe Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation is in charge of all the three schemes. These schemes \\nare administered by the Central Board of Trustees, a tripartite body consisting of the chairman, \\nnominees of the central and state governments and employees’ and employers’ organizations \\nThe Central Provident Fund Commissioner is the chief executive officer of the organisation \\nand secretary to the Central Board of Trustees. He is assisted by the Regional Provident Fund \\nCommissioner, one in each state and in Delhi. \\n Example: The regional communities advise the Central Board on matters connected with \\nthe administration of the scheme in their respective States. Sub-regional provident fund offices \\nhave been opened in some region’s to render better services to the subscribers of the fund. \\nProvident fund inspectors are appointed to carry out inspections and to-perform an advisory \\nrole vis-a-vis the employers and workers in different covered establishments. They conduct \\nsurveys to ensure that all coverable establishment/factories are covered under the Act. They also \\nrecommend and file prosecutions in the courts against defaulting employers and pursue these \\ncases till their final disposal.'),\n",

Co. vs The Textile Labour \\n on 17 March, 1960\\nT\\nhis was an appeal by certain textile mills of Ahmedabad against a scheme for gratuity \\nawarded by the Industrial Court. The Labour Association, the respondent, gave a \\nnotice of change under s. 42(2) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946 (Bom. \\nXI of 1947), intimating the Mill Owners’ Association that they wanted a scheme for gratuity \\nand mentioned four categories of termination of service in the annexure. This demand \\nwas refused and so referred to the Industrial Court under s. 73A of the Act. Pending the \\nreference the Employees’ Provident Funds Act, 1952 (19 of 1952), came into operation and \\nthe Industrial Court, on an objection by the Mill Owners’ Association, held that it was \\ninadvisable to proceed with the reference and that a fresh application should be made, if \\nnecessary, after the scheme envisaged by the Act is introduced.\\nA scheme for gratuity is by its nature an integrated scheme and covers all classes of \\ntermination of service where gratuity benefit can be legitimately claimed and the refusal \\nof the Industrial Court in the earlier award amounted to a refusal to frame any scheme at \\nall. The statutory provident fund created by the Employees’ Provident Funds Act, 1952, \\ncould be no bar to the respondent’s claim for a gratuity scheme although there can be no \\ndoubt that in awarding such a scheme Industrial Courts must make due allowance for it. \\nProvisions of s. 17 of the said Act clearly indicate that the statutory benefits under the Act \\nare the minimum to which the employees are entitled and that they are no bar to additional \\nbenefits claimed by the employees. Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen, [1960] \\n2 S.C.R. 32, referred to. It was not correct to say that the claim for gratuity was essentially \\nsimilar to a claim for profit bonus and must always be considered on unit wise basis. \\nThe benefit of gratuity is in the nature of a retrial thus made was not accepted by the \\nAssociation, and so it was referred to the Industrial Court. Pending the reference the \\nEmployees’ Provident Funds Act, 1952 (19 of 1952), came into operation on March 4, \\n1952, and it was urged before the Industrial Court on behalf of the Association that since \\nthe statutory scheme of provident fund would soon become compulsory it would not be \\nadvisable to adjudicate upon the respondent’s claim for the specified items of gratuity \\nat that stage. This argument was accepted by the Industrial Court; it held that when the \\nscheme envisaged by the new Act is introduced it would be possible to see from what date \\nit would be operative, and that, if after the introduction of the said scheme it be found that \\na sufficient margin is left, it would then be open to the respondent and the Association to \\nmake a fresh application for the institution of a gratuity fund either for all the employees \\nor for the benefit of such of them as will have to retire within the next few years. It was on \\nthis ground that the demand made by the respondent was rejected on April.\\nThe Act has been passed by the Bombay Legislature because it thought that “it was \\nexpedient to provide for the regulation of the relations of employers and employees in \\ncertain matters, to consolidate and amend the law relating to the settlement of industrial \\ndisputes and to provide for certain other purposes” With this object the Act has made \\nelaborate provisions for the regulation of industrial relationships and for the speedy \\ndisposal of industrial disputes. An “industrial dispute” under s. 3, sub-s. (17), means \\n“any dispute or difference between an employer and employer, or between employers \\nand employees, or between employees and employees and which is connected with any \\nindustrial matter”. The expression “industrial matter has been inclusively defined in a very \\nwide sense approved Union“ in s. 3(2) means “a union on the approved list” “primary \\nunion” under s. 3(28) means “a union for the time being registered as a primary union \\nContd...'),\n",

At the end of this unit you should be able to understand various concepts regarding \\nthe Maternity Benefit Act.\\n12.1 Genesis of the Act\\nThe Convention of “Protection of Motherhood” adopted in 1919 was the earliest among the \\nILO Conventions. In 1921, the Government of India reported that it was not possible to adopt \\nthe Convention passed in 1919 due to various reasons. A Bill was brought before the Central \\nLegislative Assembly by a private member in 1924; urging the Government to make it compulsory \\nfor the employers to provide maternity benefit to women workers. However, the Bill was opposed \\nby the government on the ground that the need for such a Bill was not felt and that if legislation \\nwas passed to that effect, it might have adverse repercussions on the employment of women. \\nThe Royal Commission on Labour, in its recommendations, also stressed the need for suitable \\nmaternity legislation, at least for women employed permanently in non seasonal factories. As the \\nGovernment of India was slow to ‘act on these recommendations, the provincial governments \\ntook the lead. The Government of Bombay passed the Maternity Benefit Act, way back in 1926. It \\nwas followed by Central Provinces, Madras, U.P., Bengal and some other provinces. The period \\nof leave, the quantum of benefit and the qualifying conditions varied slightly from province. With \\na view to reducing the disparities relating to maternity protection under different provincial or \\nState enactments, the Central Government passed the Maternity Benefit Act in 1961.\\nThe Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) in the Ministry of Labour is responsible for \\nenforcing this Act. CIRM is an attached office of the Ministry and is also known as the Chief \\nLabour Commissioner (Central) [CLC(C)] Organisation. The CIRM is headed by the Chief Labour \\nCommissioner (Central).\\n12.1.1 Main Provisions\\nThe main provisions of the Act are:-\\nzl No employer shall knowingly employ a woman in any establishment during the six weeks \\nimmediately following the day of her delivery or her miscarriage. Also, no woman shall \\nwork in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her \\ndelivery or her miscarriage.\\nzl Every woman shall be entitled to, and her employer shall be liable for, the payment of \\nmaternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence \\nimmediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks \\nimmediately following that day. The ‘average daily wage’ means the average of the \\nwoman’s wages payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of \\nthree calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on \\naccount of maternity, or one rupee a day, which ever is higher.\\nzl No woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has actually worked in an \\nestablishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity benefit, for a period of \\nnot less than one hundred and sixty days in the twelve months immediately preceding the \\ndate of her expected delivery. For the purpose of calculating the days on which a woman \\nhas actually worked in the establishment, the days for which she has been laid off during \\nthe period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery shall \\nbe taken into account.\\nzl The maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit shall be \\ntwelve weeks, that is to say, six weeks up to and including the day of her delivery and six \\nweeks immediately following that day.'),\n",

She became pregnant. \\nShe absented for 106 days. She applied for maternity leave. She was directed to hand \\nover charge. Her absence was treated as leave without pay. Maternity benefits were \\ndenied to her as per terms of contractual employment. The petitioner was notified that till \\nthe date of handing over the charge, the absence will be treated as leave without allowance \\nand she was directed to hand over the office mobile and other assets, if any. Since the \\nmaternity leave applied was not sanctioned, the petitioner got issued a legal notice for \\nsanction of maternity leave and for extending the legitimate benefits. \\nThe petitioner delivered twins. The respondent terminated the contract of service with \\nthe petitioner by invoking terms and conditions of her appointment letter. The petitioner \\nfiled writ petition to quash the communications sent by the respondent, terminating the \\ncontract and office order treating the period of absence as leave without allowances and to \\ndirect the respondent to sanction maternity leave and disburse the pay and allowances for \\nthe period of maternity leave and for consequential benefits, including permitting her to \\nresume duty after the expiry of the maternity leave or as per the medical advice. \\nThe respondent in the counter has resisted the demands of the petitioner contending that \\nthe petitioner accepted the offer and is bound by the terms and conditions of the contract \\nwhich does not provide for maternity leave benefits and hence, it is not open to the petitioner \\nto claim maternity leave benefits. The respondent further stated that as the petitioner \\nremained absent frequently on different dates on health grounds, issuance of the office \\norder is justified. It was also stated that the post to which the petitioner was appointed was \\ncrucial post of Manager (Finance) which could not be kept vacant and it adversely affects \\nthe work. She was given one month’s notice and thereafter her service was terminated. \\nEven the respondent is not notified under section 2 of the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. \\nHeld, in terms of the provisions of the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961, a woman is prohibited \\nfrom working in an establishment during the period of six weeks from immediately \\nfollowing the day of her delivery, miscarriage or medical termination of pregnancy. She \\nwould not be asked to work for the specified period in sub-section (4) of section 4. She \\nwould be entitled to the benefits of sections 6 and 9 of the Act. Any Rule or Regulation \\nbeing subordinate legislation, is subject to provisions of the Parliament Act. Though the \\nappointment order along with the terms and conditions appended thereto issued to the \\npetitioner did not provide for grant of maternity leave and other benefits to which a woman \\nemployee would be entitled to, the respondent has an obligation to provide the benefits in \\nview of the provisions contained in the Act as well as the Directive Principles of State Policy \\nenshrined in Article 42 of the Constitution of India. It is not disputed that the petitioner had \\n17 days in her credit whereas she remained absent for 106 days on health ground.\\nSince she was a contract employee and did not have the leave to her credit, the respondent \\nis right in treating the period as leave without allowance in excess of leave to her credit. \\nPetitioner’s prayer to permit her to resume her duty is not tenable since the appointment \\nwas purely on contract basis and that period is already over.

The Employees’ State \\nInsurance Act was promulgated by the Parliament of India in the year 1948. It was the first major \\nlegislation on Social Security in independent India to provide certain benefits to the employees \\nin the organized sector in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury. It is important \\nfor the students to be thoroughly acclimatized with this branch of law to know its practical \\nsignificance. The Employees State Insurance Act, 1948 has been enacted with the objective of \\nwelfare of the employees and benefits in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury \\nand certain other related matters. Articles 41, 42 and 43 of the Indian Constitution enjoin \\nthe state to make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and public \\nassistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement. The Act attempts to \\nachieve such goal of socio-economic justice enshrined in the Directive principles of state policy \\nunder part 4 of the Constitution. The benefits extended under this Act are applicable to all \\nemployees whether working inside the factory or establishment or else where they are directly \\nemployed by the principal employee or through an intermediate agency, if the employment is \\nincidental or in connection with the factory or establishment. The Act applies to non-seasonal, \\npower using factories or manufacturing units employing ten or more persons and non-power \\nusing establishments employing twenty or more persons. The purpose of this Unit is to enable \\nthe students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you should be able to \\nunderstand various concepts regarding ESIC.\\n13.1 Definitions\\nEmployee \\nThe term “employee” as defined under Section 2(9) of the Act, refers to any person employed on \\nwages in, or in connection with, the work of a factory or establishment to which this Act applies. It \\nhas a wide connotation and includes within its scope clerical, manual, technical and supervisory \\nfunctions. Persons whose remuneration (excluding the remuneration for over-time work) does \\nnot exceed ` 6,500 a month are covered under the Act. The Act does not make any distinction \\nbetween casual and temporary employees or between technical and non-technical employees. \\nThere is also no distinction between those employed on time-rate and piece-rate basis.\\nNotes  Employees employed directly by the principal employer and those employed \\nby or through a contractor on the premises of the factory and those employed outside the \\nfactory premises under the supervision of the principal employer are all included under \\nthe Act: It also covers administrative staff and persons engaged in the purchase of raw \\nmaterials or the distribution or sale of products and similar or related functions. However, \\nthe definition of “employee” does not include any member of the Indian naval, military or \\nair force.'),\n",

Pregnant women \\nhave a particularly bad time.\\nThey are seen standing in the queue for long hours to get their registration done for a \\ncheck-up as the hospital doesn’t allow male family members to stand in line for them.\\n“Husband or family members accompanying the patients are treated as cattle class.

So I left the hospital without treatment,” she said.\\nShe was not alone, and around 20 to 30 patients shared her plight. Some of them had been \\ntrying to meet the doctor for a week.\\n“There are no attendants to guide and help. We have to deal with security guards who are \\nrude,” said Shalini Sharma.\\nESIC claims to be one of the largest social security organisations in the world and has state-\\nof-art facilities at its various hospitals.\\nSource: http://www.deccanherald.com/content/290769/endless-wait-noida-esi-hospital.html'),\n",

The subject of health insurance for industrial workers was first discussed in 1927 \\nby the Indian Legislature, when the applicability of the Conventions adopted by the International \\nLabour Conference was considered by the Government of India. The Royal Commission on \\nLabour, in its report (1931), stressed the need for health insurance for workers in India. One of \\nthe earlier decisions of the Labour Ministers’ Conferences between 1940 and 1942 was to invite an \\nexpert to frame a scheme of health insurance for workers. In pursuance thereof, the responsibility \\nfor preparing a detailed scheme of health insurance for industrial workers was entrusted in March \\n1943 to Prof. B.P. Adarkar who submitted his report in December 1944. This was considered by \\nthe Government of India and State governments as well as other interested parties. The Adarkar \\nPlan and various other suggestions emerged finally in the form of Workmen’s State Insurance \\nBill 1946, which was then referred to a Select Committee in November 12, 1947: The Select \\nCommittee. extended the cover-age to all the employees in factories, and changed its name from \\nWorkmen’s State Insurance Bill to Employees’ State Insurance Bill.\\nDid u know?  The Employees’ State Insurance Act came into force from 19th April 1948. The \\nscheme framed under the Act aims at providing for certain cash benefits to employees in \\nthe event of sickness, maternity, employment injury, and medical facilities in kind, and 18 \\ncontains provisions for certain other matters having bearing thereon.\\nThe Employee State Insurance Act, [ESIC] 1948, is a piece of social welfare legislation enacted \\nprimarily with the object of providing certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity \\nand employment injury and also to make provision for certain others matters incidental thereto. \\nThe Act in fact tries to attain the goal of socio-economic justice enshrined in the Directive \\nprinciples of state policy under part 4 of our Constitution, in particular articles 41, 42 and 43 \\nwhich enjoin the state to make effective provision for securing, the right to work, to education and \\npublic assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement. The act strives \\nto materialise these avowed objects through only to a limited extent. This Act becomes a wider \\nspectrum than factory Act. In the sense that while the factory Act concerns with the health, safety, \\nwelfare, leave etc. of the workers employed in the factory premises only. But the benefits of this \\nAct extend to employees whether working inside the factory or establishment or else where or \\nthey are directly employed by the principal employee or through an intermediate agency, if the \\nemployment is incidental or in connection with the factory or establishment.\\n13.2.1 Objectives of this Act\\nThe object of the Act is to secure sickness, maternity, disablement and medical benefits to \\nemployees of factories and establishments and dependents’ benefits to the dependents of such \\nemployees.'),\n",

It is one of the benefits to be provided on a universal basis under the Social \\nProtection Floor programme envisaged by the ILO.\\nImprovement in the health status of the population by providing access to health care \\nand facilitating utilisation of health, family welfare, and nutrition services with special \\nfocus on the underserved has been the main thrust of social development programs in \\nthe country. The responsibility of building infrastructure and manpower rests with the \\nState governments, supported by funds from the Central Government. Major disease \\ncontrol programmes and family welfare programmes are funded by the Centre (some \\nwith assistance from external agencies) and are implemented through the infrastructure \\nprovided by the States.\\nThere are a variety of arrangements available for providing healthcare to people in India. \\nThey consist, from the point of view of financing, of social assistance programmes, social \\ninsurance schemes including the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) and Rashtriya \\nSwasthya Bima Yojana, health insurance schemes introduced by State governments, and \\nhealth insurance schemes run by insurance companies in the public as well as private \\nsector. As far as the actual provision of healthcare services is concerned, there are \\nhospitals and dispensaries being run by Central and State Governments, including the \\nCentral Government Health Service Scheme, the Railways Health Service Scheme, Defence \\nServices Health Service Scheme, the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), as well \\nas hospitals and dispensaries being run by private and voluntary agencies.\\nYet coverage of all these arrangements is limited and there is a wide gap between demand \\nand supply for these services.

The Committee has further recommended that \\ninsurance companies (for profit ones) not be used for the purchase of healthcare on behalf \\nof the Government.\\nThere is however lack of clarity about the role of various agencies in providing healthcare. \\nIn particular, the policy papers are silent about the role of the Employees State Insurance \\nCorporation.\\nThe ESIC is a statutory corporation responsible for administration of the Employees State \\nInsurance Scheme framed under the Employees State Insurance Act. This scheme was, \\nuntil recently, the only social insurance scheme in the country. The main objective of the \\nScheme is to provide certain benefits to workers and their families in the event of sickness, \\nmaternity, employment injury or death of workers.\\nOf all the services offered by the ESIC, the Corporation attaches the greatest importance \\nto medical benefit; bulk of its funding is used for providing this benefit. Medical benefit \\nis available to an insured person and his family in kind from the date of his entry into \\ninsurable employment. Medical benefit has also been extended to permanently disabled \\npersons who cease to be in employment due to employment injury. The benefit is also \\nextended to insured persons after their retirement on the same conditions.\\nThe Scheme provides for comprehensive medical care in the form of medical attendance \\nand specialist consultations, supply of drugs and injections, free hospitalization care, \\noutpatient service, specialist and hospital services.\\nWithin the ambit of the program is a drive towards immunisation of young children, of \\ninsured persons against diseases like diphtheria, polio, tetanus, measles and tuberculosis. \\nIt provides family welfare services to the beneficiaries of the Scheme. Insured persons \\nand members of their families are provided with artificial limbs, hearing aids, cervical \\ncollars, walking calipers, crutches, wheelchairs and pacemakers as part of their medical \\ntreatment.\\nConceptually, from the point of view of the insured persons, the ESI Scheme can be \\nsaid to be one of the best medical insurance schemes in India. But it suffers from several \\ndrawbacks.\\nThe Act envisages that the medical benefits will be provided by the State Governments; \\nthe Corporation may enter into agreements with these State Governments to decide the \\nnature and scale of medical treatment that should be provided and cost sharing thereof. \\nThe Act also provides for the Corporation itself, in consultation with the State government \\nconcerned, undertaking the responsibility of providing medical benefit to insured persons \\nin a State. Accordingly, medical treatment and attending to insured persons and their \\nfamilies is being provided by the State Governments everywhere, except in Delhi where \\nthe Corporation has undertaken this responsibility.\\nThe responsibility for creating the necessary infrastructure for providing medical benefits \\ntherefore rests with the State Governments though the cost is met by the Corporation. The \\ninability or the unwillingness of the State governments to discharge this responsibility has \\ncome in the way of expansion of the ESI Scheme. This is one of the reasons for the slow \\ngrowth of the scheme.\\nThe arrangements under which the Corporation provides funds and the State Governments \\nimplement the scheme has come in for criticism on the ground that there is a dichotomy in \\nthe administration of medical benefit which is not conducive to efficiency and has resulted \\nin dissatisfaction among the insured persons.

Gratuity is a voluntary Payment made by the employer to the \\nemployee in recognition of continuous, meritorious services and sincere efforts by the employee \\ntowards the organization. It is governed under the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972. It is an Act \\nto provide for a scheme for the payment of gratuity to employees engaged in factories, mines, \\nOilfields, plantations, ports, railway companies, and shops or other establishments. The purpose \\nof this Unit is to enable the students to comprehend basic expressions. At the end of this unit you \\nshould be able to understand various concepts the Payment of Gratuity Act.\\n14.1 Genesis of the Act\\nGratuity as an additional retirement benefit has been secured by labour in numerous instances, \\neither by agreement or by awards. It was conceded as a provision for old age and a reward for \\ngood, efficient and faithful service for a considerable period. But in the early stages, gratuity was \\ntreated as a payment gratuitously made by an employer at his will and pleasure. In the course \\nof time, gratuity came to be paid as a result of bilateral agreements or industrial adjudication. \\nEven though the payment of gratuity was voluntary in character, it had led to several industrial \\ndisputes. The Supreme Court had laid down certain broad principles to serve as guidelines for \\nthe framing of the gratuity scheme. They were \\n1. The general financial stability of the concern; \\n2. Its profit-earning capacity; \\n3. Profits earned in the past; \\n4. Reserves and the possibility of replenishing the reserves; and \\n5. Return on capital, regard being had to the risk involved. \\nThe first central legislation to regulate the payment of gratuity was the Working Journalists \\n(Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955. The Government of Kerala \\nenacted legislation in 1971, for payment of gratuity to workers employed in factories, plantations, \\nshops and establishments. In 1971, the West Bengal Government promulgated an ordinance \\nwhich was subsequently replaced by the West Bengal Employees’ Payment of Compulsory \\nGratuity Act, 1971. After the enactment of these two Acts, some other state governments also \\nvoiced their intention of enacting similar measures in their respective states. It became necessary, \\ntherefore, to have a Central law on the subject so as -\\nzl to ensure a uniform pattern of payment of gratuity to the employees throughout the \\ncountry, and\\nzl to avoid different treatment to the employees of establishment having branches in more \\nthan one state, when, under the conditions of their service, the employees were liable to \\ntransfer from one state to another.\\nHence the Government of India enacted legislation on gratuity. The Act came into force from \\nSeptember 16, 1972. The Payment of Gratuity Central Rules also came into force from September \\n16, 1.972.\\nDid u know?  The Act is administered by the Central Government in:- (i) establishments \\nwhich are under its control; (ii) establishments having branches in more than one State; and \\n(iii) major ports, mines, oil fields and the railways. While, in all other cases, it is administered \\nby the State Governments and the Union Territory administrations. The appropriate \\nGovernment may, by notification, appoint any officer to be a controlling authority, who'),\n",

The employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at the rate of fifteen days’ wages based \\non the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned for every completed year of \\nservice or part thereof in excess of six months.\\n Example:  In the case of a monthly rated employee, the fifteen days’ wages shall \\nbe calculated by dividing the monthly rate of wages last drawn by him by twenty-six and \\nmultiplying the quotient by fifteen. While, in the case of a piece-rated employee, daily wages \\nshall be computed on the average of the total wages received by him for a period of three months \\nimmediately preceding the termination of his employment, and, for this purpose, the wages paid \\nfor any overtime work shall not be taken into account.\\n3. The amount of gratuity payable to an employee shall not exceed three lakhs and fifty \\nthousand rupees.\\n4. For the purpose of computing the gratuity payable to an employee who is employed, after \\nhis disablement, on reduced wages, his wages for the period preceding his disablement \\nshall be taken to be the wages received by him during that period, and his wages for the \\nperiod subsequent to his disablement shall be taken to be the reduced wages.\\n5. The gratuity of an employee, whose services have been terminated for any act, willful \\nomission or negligence causing any damage or loss to, or destruction of, property belonging \\nto the employer, shall be forfeited to the extent of the damage or loss so caused. \\nNotes  The gratuity payable to an employee may be wholly or partially forfeited:- (i) \\nif the services of such employee have been terminated for his riotous or disorderly conduct \\nor any other act of violence on his part; or (ii) if the services of such employee have been \\nterminated for any act which constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude, provided \\nthat such offence is committed by him in the course of his employment.\\n6. If the amount of gratuity payable under this Act is not paid by the employer, within \\nthe prescribed time, to the person entitled thereto, the controlling authority shall, on an \\napplication made to it in this behalf by the aggrieved person, issue a certificate for that \\namount to the Collector, who shall recover the same, together with compound interest \\nthereon at such rate as the Central Government may, by notification, specify, from the date \\nof expiry of the prescribed time, as arrears of land revenue and pay the same to the person \\nentitled thereto.'),\n",

The Deputy Labour  \\n Commissioner and the Appellate Authority\\nT\\nhe 3rd Respondent an employee of the Petitioner- Road Transport Corporation \\non attaining the age of superannuation on 30.4.2005, was entitled to gratuity by \\ncomputing the quantum either in terms of the KSRTC Servants Gratuity Regulations, \\nfor short Regulations or the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, for short Act, whichever is \\nbeneficial. Petitioner reckoned 27 years and 6 months as the period of continuous service, \\nby excluding 7 years, 3 months and 22 days from out of 34 years, 9 months and 29 days, \\nalleging absence, leave without salary, suspension and others and accordingly, computed  \\n` 1,70,500 as gratuity, in terms of the Regulations, from out of which was deducted ` 54,350 \\non the premise that the 3rd Respondent was liable to pay towards discharge of a loan \\nextended by the State Bank of Mysore, HSR Layout, while in service. The 3rd Respondent \\naggrieved by the exclusion of the period of service and the deduction towards discharge of \\nloan, filed an application under Rule 10 of the Payment of Gratuity (Central) Rules, 1972, \\nbefore the 2nd Respondent- Controlling Authority. In the appeal, the Petitioner contended \\nthat 7 years, 3 months and 22 days being the break in service and not ‘continuous service’ \\nwithin the definition of the said term under Section 2(A) of the Act deserves exclusion \\nfor computation of gratuity, since the 3rd Respondent was absent, suffered orders of \\nleave without salary, suspension and others while in service. It is next contended that the \\n3rd Respondent having not discharged the debt due to State Bank of Mysore, hence the \\ndeduction of ` 54,350. The Court observed that the requirement of Section 2A of the Act \\nin order to establish interrupted service so as to treat it as break in service is the orders \\npassed in that regard treating the period of absence as break inservice, in accordance with \\nthe standing orders, rules or regulations governing the employees of the establishment. In \\nthe instant case, there is no evidence to establish orders passed by the Authorities treating \\nas break-in-service the period of suspension, leave without salary, absence from service \\nand others, since mere absence, per se, is not break-in service, breach falling within the \\ndefinition of the term ‘continuity of service’ under the Act. In that view of the matter, no \\nexception can be taken to the reasons, findings and conclusions arrived by the Controlling \\nAuthority and Appellate Authority under the Act, declining to accept the plea to treat that \\nperiod as break in service, and deny a computation of gratuity by including the said period \\nas ‘continuous service’. The Court further held that the last contention over justification to \\ndeduct and discharge the loan with the State Bank of Mysore, HSR Layout, is frivolous.  \\nSub-Sections (1) and (6) of Section 4 of the Act when read, in conjunction, the only irresistible \\nconclusion is deduction by way of forfeiture to the extent of damage or loss caused by the \\nemployee during his service, from the gratuity of that employee, whose service is terminated \\nfor any act, willful omission or negligence causing any damage or loss or destruction of \\nproperty belonging to the employer; and the gratuity payable to an employee may be \\nwholly or partially forfeited; if the service of such employee is terminated for his riotous \\ndisorderly conduct or any other act of violence on his part; or if the service of such employee \\nis terminated for any act which constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude, provided \\nthat such offence is committed by him in the course of his employment. The Court held \\nthat in the instant case the service of the 3rd Respondent was not terminated for any of the \\naforesaid reasons, so as to withhold gratuity on the wholly or partially so as to fall within \\nthe Sub-Section (6) of Section 4 of the Act. That being the factual position, deduction of  \\n` 54,350 allegedly towards discharge of the loan extended to the 3rd Respondent by the State \\nBank of Mysore.
